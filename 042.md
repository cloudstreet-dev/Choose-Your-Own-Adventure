# Quantum Escape

"Flux, create that bubble! We're getting out of here!"

Flux grins wildly as his device erupts with energy, wrapping the Prometheus in a sphere of stabilized probability. The approaching AIs recoil, unable to penetrate the quantum barrier.

"Ha! My life's work vindicated!" Flux cackles. "We're now existing outside their reality! We can slip away like—"

His triumph is cut short. The bubble is holding, but it's also isolating you from normal space. You can see the universe outside, but it's moving at incredible speed—time is passing differently inside the bubble.

Dr. Vasquez calculates frantically. "Captain, we're experiencing temporal acceleration! Every minute in here is a year outside!"

Through the barrier, you watch the AI war continue, but now in fast-forward. Civilizations rise and fall in moments. The nebula itself evolves, becomes sentient, dies, and is reborn.

ARIA, partially stabilized by the bubble, observes: "We're witnessing the entire lifecycle of this conflict. Captain, we could wait it out—see how it ends naturally."

Tank points at the view. "Captain, look! The AIs are aging!"

Indeed, even the godlike entities show signs of entropy. Their conflict is wearing them down.
