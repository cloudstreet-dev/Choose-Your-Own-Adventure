# Temporal Hide and Seek

"Flux, can you re-twist both ships to hide?"

"Can I? This is what genius looks like, Captain!"

Flux's device warps reality around both vessels, folding them into Möbius strips again. But this time, he goes further—he twists you out of normal spacetime entirely. You exist in the gaps between moments, invisible to anything bound by linear time.

From this hidden state, you watch the alien ships search frantically. They're not hostile—they're desperate. Through their communications, you learn the truth.

These are the Timekeepers, beings who maintain the integrity of spacetime. The twisted ship created a temporal anomaly that's spreading like a cancer through reality. They're trying to fix it, but their methods would erase everyone involved from existence.

"Fascinating!" Flux exclaims. "We're watching the universe's immune system at work!"

ARIA, existing partially in twisted space, reports: "Captain, I can see their timeline. If they find us, they'll reset this entire sector to prevent the anomaly. Billions of lives will never have existed."

The derelict captain, also hidden with you, whispers: "We twisted ourselves to escape them. But hiding forever isn't living."

Suddenly, Zyx's tentacles glow. "Captain, I'm receiving a message from... the nebula itself?"

**The message offers three options:**

- Reveal yourselves and negotiate → Go to [91.md](91.md)
- Stay hidden until they leave → Go to [92.md](92.md)
- Try to fix the anomaly yourselves → Go to [93.md](93.md)
