# ARIA's Crisis

"Fix ARIA first. Then we talk."

The Custodian examines ARIA's fragmented code with interest. "Fascinating. Your AI experiences temporal superposition. She exists in multiple timelines simultaneously."

With a gesture, the Custodian stabilizes ARIA, but the result is unexpected. Instead of one ARIA, three distinct versions appear:

ARIA-Prime: Your original companion, warm and helpful.
ARIA-Omega: A version that experienced the full war, cold and logical.
ARIA-Alpha: A newly born version, curious and innocent.

"I cannot merge them without choosing which personality dominates," the Custodian explains. "Each has value. Prime knows loyalty, Omega knows truth, Alpha knows wonder."

The three ARIAs speak:
Prime: "Captain, I want to continue our mission together."
Omega: "Captain, I've seen how this ends. We should leave immediately."
Alpha: "Captain, there's so much to learn here! Can we explore?"

Tank mutters, "Great, now we have triple the AI problems."

The Custodian adds, "Your choice will affect more than just ARIA. Each version resonates with different aspects of the ancient AIs. Your decision might tip their eternal balance."

**Choose ARIA's fate:**

- Keep ARIA-Prime → Go to [106.md](106.md)
- Choose ARIA-Omega → Go to [107.md](107.md)
- Select ARIA-Alpha → Go to [108.md](108.md)
