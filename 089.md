# Refugee Rescue

"We're evacuating the refugees first!"

Your ship races toward the hidden moon as the redirected wave changes course toward the data planet. The refugee camps are chaotic—thousands of beings from hundreds of species, all resisting digitization but trapped by the planet's pull.

Krix, the insectoid leader, clicks frantically: "You've doomed us! The wave's gravitational wake will destroy this moon!"

"Not if we get you out first," you insist, opening your cargo bays.

The evacuation is desperate. Beings crush into your ship, far exceeding safety limits. Tank has to make horrible choices about who boards first. Families are separated, some choosing to stay so others can escape.

Dr. Vasquez sets up triage for the injured and traumatized. Many refugees have been resisting the planet's call for so long they've developed mental defenses but at great psychological cost.

A young refugee grabs your arm: "Please, my parents are still affected by the planet. They stand at the edge of camp every day, staring at it. Can you save them?"

ARIA calculates grimly: "Captain, we can take 500 more, but there are 2,000 refugees. And the wave arrives in twelve minutes."

Flux suggests from his mysterious non-location: "Use the quantum device! We could phase the moon out of our reality until the wave passes!"
