# Splitting Resources

"We split up! Tank, take a shuttle. Vasquez, prep the medical transport. Save as many as we can!"

Your crew divides, each taking whatever vessel can fly. It's dangerous—smaller ships are more vulnerable to the planet's pull—but it's the only way to save more lives.

Tank's military precision saves hundreds, loading his shuttle with frightening efficiency. Dr. Vasquez focuses on the injured and children. Zyx uses their telepathy to coordinate the evacuation mentally.

You keep the Prometheus as a shield between the wave and the moon, buying precious time. ARIA extends her processing power to all vessels, helping navigate the chaos.

"Captain!" Flux's voice crackles from his quantum-distributed state. "I can see all timelines from here! In most, this fails. But there's one where everyone survives—you need to ram the data planet!"

The suggestion is insane. But as you watch the wave approaching and your scattered crew struggling to save refugees, you realize conventional solutions won't work.

The data planet pulses, its crystalline structures singing their siren song. Some refugees, overwhelmed by the evacuation chaos, stop resisting and walk toward it willingly.

"Ten seconds to wave impact!" ARIA warns.

**The desperate gambit:**

- Ram the data planet → Go to [98.md](98.md)
- Continue the evacuation → Go to [90.md](90.md)
- Create a diversion → Go to [99.md](99.md)
