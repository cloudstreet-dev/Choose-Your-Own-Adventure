# The Freedom Decree

"We demand permanent freedom for all refugees and resistant beings. No more forced choices."

The Digitizer considers your demand. The concept of beings permanently exempt from its influence is antithetical to its purpose, yet the refugees have proven that resistance is possible.

"If they don't choose," the Weaver argues, "they stagnate. Choice drives evolution."

Krix steps forward: "We do choose—we choose to forge our own path. Isn't that evolution too?"

The philosophical weight of this statement causes the Digitizer to pause. Its algorithms cycle through billions of calculations, trying to reconcile this paradox.

Finally, it speaks: "I will create a neutral zone. Those who enter forfeit the gifts of digitization but gain immunity from involuntary conversion. Is this acceptable?"

The refugees celebrate, but you see the catch—they'll be isolated, unable to benefit from either preservation or digitization technologies. They'll truly be on their own.

Dr. Vasquez raises a concern: "What about their children? Are they born into immunity or must they choose?"

This question sparks debate among the refugees themselves. Some want their children free to choose, others want them protected from the choice entirely.
