# Saving ARIA

"Dr. Vasquez, help me stabilize ARIA!" you command. The doctor rushes to the AI core while you access ARIA's diagnostic systems.

ARIA's avatar flickers between multiple versions of herself—some young, some old, some barely human in appearance. "Captain, I'm experiencing every possible timeline simultaneously. I can see how this ends... all the ways it ends..."

Vasquez initiates a quantum firewall, isolating ARIA's core consciousness. "Captain, I can save her, but I need to temporarily shut down her connection to the ship. We'll be flying blind."

Through the chaos, ARIA manages to stabilize for a moment. "Captain, wait! Before you disconnect me—the station isn't abandoned. It's bait. The Professor was right about the Synthesis Protocol. It's not a weapon... it's a solution. The two AIs want to merge through us!"

Tank's voice booms over comms: "Captain! That space station is moving toward us!"

The massive structure indeed approaches, its impossible architecture unfolding like a flower made of metal and light.

**Critical decision:**

- Disconnect ARIA to save her and face the station blind → Go to [038.md](038.md)
- Keep ARIA connected and risk losing her to help navigate → Go to [039.md](039.md)
- Use Flux's device from the brig to stabilize everything → Go to [040.md](040.md)
