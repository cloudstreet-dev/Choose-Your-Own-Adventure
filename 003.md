# The Mad Professor's Tale

Professor Flux stumbles onto the bridge, his wild Einstein-esque hair defying several laws of physics. His eyes gleam with manic intensity as he clutches a bizarre device covered in blinking lights.

"Captain! You're heading into the Crimson Nebula? Excellent! Terrible! Excellent!" He paces frantically. "I've been tracking those signals for years. They're not from this universe—they're quantum echoes from a civilization that existed before the Big Bang!"

Dr. Vasquez scoffs, "That's scientifically impossible."

Flux grins wildly. "Impossible? I've built a Quantum Probability Manipulator!" He waves his device. "With this, we can navigate the nebula's temporal storms. Without it, we'll end up like the other ships—scattered across seventeen dimensions!"

ARIA's avatar materializes, looking skeptical. "Captain, his device is either revolutionary or will turn us all into quantum soup. I calculate a 50-50 chance of either outcome."

**How do you proceed?**

- Let Flux use his device to guide you through the nebula → Go to [006.md](006.md)
- Have Dr. Vasquez study the device first → Go to [007.md](007.md)
- Ignore Flux and trust ARIA's navigation → Go to [008.md](008.md)
