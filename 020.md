# Manual Navigation

"We'll save the device charges. ARIA, plot a careful course."

Your ship moves slowly through the crimson chaos. Without the device, navigation is treacherous. The crew works overtime, manually adjusting for each quantum fluctuation.

Hours pass. Tank reports strange readings: "Captain, I'm seeing shadows of ships that aren't there. Like echoes."

"Temporal echoes," Dr. Vasquez explains. "We're seeing ships that traveled this route in alternate timelines."

Suddenly, one shadow becomes solid—another Prometheus, but battle-scarred and ancient. Its hull bears an inscription: "Loop 1,847 - Still searching for the way home."

ARIA scans it. "Captain... that ship's logs show it's us. From a future where we never escaped the nebula. We've been repeating this journey for centuries."

The other ship powers up weapons, and your own face appears on screen—older, harder, desperate. "I won't let you make my mistakes! Turn back now, or I'll make you!"

Flux yells from the brig: "It's a temporal paradox! If you fight yourself, you'll create the very loop you're trying to avoid!"

- Try to reason with your future self → Go to [059.md](059.md)
- Attempt to escape without confrontation → Go to [060.md](060.md)
- Use one device charge to break the paradox → Go to [061.md](061.md)
