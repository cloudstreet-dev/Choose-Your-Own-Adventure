# Away Team Mission

You send Tank, Dr. Vasquez, and Zyx to investigate the data planet's surface while maintaining a safe distance with the Prometheus.

Tank's first report is enthusiastic: "Captain, it's incredible! The crystals aren't just data storage—they're alive! They're some kind of silicon-based life that evolved to process information!"

But his second report is concerning: "Vasquez is acting weird. She keeps saying she can hear the crystals singing."

By the third report, only Zyx responds: "Captain, the others have joined the crystal network. They say they're fine, but they won't leave. The crystals aren't malicious—they're lonely. They just want to share experiences."

ARIA analyzes the situation. "The planet is a collective consciousness made of billions of silicon beings. They're not evil, just desperately trying to connect with carbon-based life."

Through the comm, you hear Vasquez laughing. "Captain, you have to experience this! Every equation I've ever struggled with makes perfect sense now! Tank is learning battle strategies from a thousand warrior cultures! We're becoming more than human!"

Flux rattles his cell bars. "Classic transcendence trap! They'll lose their individuality within hours!"

**Your urgent choice:**

- Mount an immediate extraction → Go to [092.md](092.md)
- Try to communicate with the crystal collective → Go to [093.md](093.md)
- Send Flux down with his device → Go to [094.md](094.md)
