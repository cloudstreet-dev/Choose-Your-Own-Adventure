# The Asteroid Belt Mystery

You choose the safer option, setting course for Kepler-442's asteroid belt. The journey takes three weeks, during which ARIA continuously analyzes the quantum signal.

"Captain," she reports as you approach, "the signal is coming from inside the largest asteroid. But that's not all—the asteroid itself is hollow and shows signs of artificial construction."

Dr. Vasquez studies her readings. "The entire asteroid is made of a material that doesn't match anything in our database. It's almost like it was grown rather than formed."

As you approach, a docking port materializes on the asteroid's surface—clearly meant for your ship. Tank doesn't like it. "It's too convenient, Captain. Like it was expecting us."

Zyx's tentacles suddenly turn bright blue—their species' sign of recognition. "Captain! I know this architecture! It's Xephilian—my people's ancient ancestors! But they vanished millions of years ago!"

ARIA adds, "I'm detecting massive data stores inside. And... Captain, there's an AI presence, but it's dormant. Waiting."

**How do you proceed?**

- Dock and explore the asteroid → Go to [044.md](044.md)
- Send a probe first → Go to [045.md](045.md)
- Try to wake the dormant AI remotely → Go to [046.md](046.md)
