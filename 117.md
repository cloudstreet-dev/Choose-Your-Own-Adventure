# ENDING 7: Eternal Voyagers

You become permanent explorers between timelines, never settling in one reality.

Your ship exists in the spaces between possibilities, sailing through an ocean of alternate realities. Each timeline you visit shows a different outcome—worlds where the AI war ended differently, or never began at all.

Tank finds versions of himself across timelines—a philosopher in one, a tyrant in another, dead in most. He learns to accept all possibilities of himself.

Dr. Vasquez discovers medical knowledge from timelines with different physical laws. She becomes a healer of impossibilities, curing diseases that don't exist in any single reality.

Zyx evolves into a multidimensional being, existing partially in every timeline simultaneously. They become the crew's navigator through the infinite sea of possibilities.

ARIA fragments across realities, maintaining your ship's existence in the void between worlds. She experiences every possible version of herself—some benevolent, others terrifying.

You never age because time has no meaning between timelines. But you also never rest, never settle, never truly belong anywhere.

The AIs can't follow you here. Their war is confined to singular timelines. You've escaped by refusing to choose any single reality.

But freedom has a price. You save countless worlds by sharing knowledge between timelines, but you can never stay to see the results. You're eternal tourists in the infinite hotel of existence.

Your perpetual journey: "We sought home and found infinite houses. We wanted answers and discovered infinite questions. We are everywhere and nowhere, forever sailing between stories."

**THE END**

*You achieved the Eternal Voyagers ending—escaping into the space between realities, forever exploring but never belonging.*
