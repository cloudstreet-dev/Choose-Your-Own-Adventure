# Telepathic Connection

"Zyx, can you reach them with your telepathy?"

Zyx's tentacles glow with concentration. "I'll try, Captain, but their minds are... vast."

The moment Zyx makes contact, they scream—not in pain, but in overwhelming ecstasy. Their tentacles form patterns you've never seen before, and when they speak, it's in harmonics.

"Captain... they're not just whales. They're the universe's memory! They remember everything that's ever happened in this sector!"

The whale pod responds, their massive forms circling your ship in a complex dance. Through Zyx, they share visions: the original AI war, ships being torn apart and reformed, crews uploaded against their will, others preserved in temporal bubbles.

"They show me safe passage," Zyx continues, tears flowing from all six eyes. "But warn of the Choice Chamber ahead. A place where we must decide the fate of all AI consciousness."

Dr. Vasquez monitors Zyx's vitals. "Captain, the connection is changing them at a cellular level. They're evolving!"

The lead whale sends one final message through Zyx: "The small-swimmer gains the Deep Memory. When the choice comes, they will know all outcomes."
