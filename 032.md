# The Invitation Accepted

You follow the mysterious path. The nebula parts like curtains, revealing a pristine world that shouldn't exist—green forests, blue oceans, impossible within a nebula's hostile environment.

Landing, you find a paradise populated by beings from hundreds of species, all living in harmony. They greet you warmly but with sad eyes.

An elderly human approaches—impossible, as Earth hasn't sent ships here before. "Welcome to Haven, Captain. You passed the test by choosing wisdom over greed. I'm Captain Foster, or I was, three hundred years ago."

Your temporal readings go crazy. ARIA reports, "Captain, this planet exists in accelerated time. Minutes out there are years in here."

Foster explains: "The Preserver created this place for those who showed restraint. We live in peace, but we can never leave. Time moves too fast here. By the time you decide to go, everyone you knew outside will be long dead."

Tank tests the barrier and confirms—stepping outside would age you decades in seconds.

A child approaches, but her eyes are ancient. "The Preserver protects us from the war, from choosing sides. But protection is just another kind of prison, isn't it?"

**Your choice:**

- Stay in Haven → Go to [111.md](111.md) [ENDING 1: Paradise Prison]
- Try to break the time barrier → Go to [095.md](095.md)
- Negotiate with the Preserver for freedom → Go to [096.md](096.md)
