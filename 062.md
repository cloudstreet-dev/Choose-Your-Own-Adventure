# Following the Song Path

The Entropy Whales guide you through the nebula with graceful precision. Their path avoids all dangers, weaving between temporal storms and probability cascades like a river flowing around stones.

As you travel, Zyx changes. Their connection to the whales has awakened something ancient in their DNA. They begin to perceive time differently, seeing past and future as a single tapestry.

"Captain," Zyx says, their voice harmonizing like the whales, "I can see it now. The Choice Chamber ahead—it's not a place, it's a moment. A moment when all possibilities converge."

The whales' song grows urgent as you approach a region where space itself seems to crystallize. Dr. Vasquez gasps at her readings: "Captain, spacetime is solidifying here. It's becoming... certain. Determined."

The lead whale warns: "The Weaver-Thinker's domain. Here, free will ends. All becomes calculation. You must choose before entering: embrace certainty and know your future, or maintain uncertainty and keep your freedom."

Through the crystallized space, you see your destination: a chamber where reality splits into infinite branches, each one showing a different outcome.

ARIA observes: "Captain, if we enter that chamber, we'll have to choose not just our path, but the path for everyone affected by the AI war."

- Enter accepting certainty → Go to [113.md](113.md) [ENDING 12: The Calculated Peace]
- Enter maintaining uncertainty → Go to [94.md](94.md)
- Ask Zyx what they see → Go to [95.md](95.md)
