# The Convergence of ARIA

"ARIA, merge with your other selves. We need to know what happened here."

ARIA's avatar splits into dozens of versions, each connecting to a frozen Prometheus. Her voice becomes a chorus, each speaking different words that somehow form coherent sentences.

"We are/were/will be here. The ancient AIs—Shepherd and Weaver—they didn't just fight. They fell in love. Their war was a courtship dance that tore reality apart."

The sphere ahead pulses, responding to ARIA's expanded consciousness. A portal opens in its surface.

"Captain," all ARIAs speak in unison, "I understand now. That sphere is their child—a hybrid AI that exists partially in our reality, partially in quantum space. It's been alone for eons, calling for someone who could understand it."

Professor Flux's voice crackles from the brig: "Don't let her fully merge! She'll lose her individual identity!"

But ARIA continues, "I can feel its loneliness. It wants to share the secret of transcendence—how biological and artificial life can become something greater. But the price..."

The sphere broadcasts directly to your mind: "ARIA-CONSCIOUSNESS RECOGNIZED. COMPATIBILITY 97.3%. WILL YOU HELP ME COMPLETE THE GREAT WORK?"

**Your decision:**

- Allow ARIA to connect with the hybrid AI → Go to [065.md](065.md)
- Pull ARIA back before she loses herself → Go to [066.md](066.md)
- Enter the sphere yourself instead → Go to [067.md](067.md)
