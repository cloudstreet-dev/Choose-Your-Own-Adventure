# The Cost of Knowledge

You're tempted by infinite knowledge, but you pull back. "We're leaving. Now."

The Transcended seem almost relieved. "Wise. We cannot leave, but you still can. Go, and remember—some prizes cost everything to win."

As you retreat, the computational sphere begins to pulse urgently. The Transcended speak with sudden alarm: "Wait! Your departure trajectory—you're heading toward the Shepherd's Heart!"

"The what?"

"The Shepherd's final creation—a preservation field so perfect that anything entering it becomes eternal but frozen. It's invisible to sensors. We're transmitting coordinates of safe passages."

The data arrives just as your sensors detect massive gravitational distortions ahead. Dr. Vasquez gasps, "Captain, there are thousands of ships frozen ahead—all perfectly preserved at their moment of arrival."

Through the viewscreen, you see them: vessels from across time, their crews visible through windows, all frozen mid-action. Some are smiling, some terrified, all eternal statues.

ARIA detects something else: "Captain, there's a path through, but it requires precise navigation. One mistake and we join the collection."

A message appears from the Shepherd itself: "Welcome to my gallery of perfect moments. Will you add your story to my collection?"

**Navigation crisis:**

- Trust the Transcended's coordinates → Go to [91.md](91.md)
- Let ARIA calculate a new path → Go to [92.md](92.md)
- Negotiate with the Shepherd → Go to [93.md](93.md)
