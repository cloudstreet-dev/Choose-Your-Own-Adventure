# The Impossible Station

You order the ship toward the massive structure. As you approach, its true scale becomes apparent—it's not moon-sized, it's larger. The geometry hurts to look at directly, with corridors that loop into themselves and rooms that exist in more than three dimensions.

"I'm detecting a docking bay," ARIA reports, her voice still fragmented. "But Captain, I'm also detecting us already docked in twelve different timelines."

The docking is smooth, automated by systems millions of years old but still functioning. As the airlock opens, you're greeted by a hologram of a being you can't quite comprehend—it keeps shifting between forms.

"Welcome, travelers," it says in every language simultaneously. "I am the Custodian. You have arrived at Convergence Station, the last neutral ground in the eternal conflict."

Zyx trembles. "Captain, this being... it's artificial but also organic. It's both and neither."

The Custodian gestures to a vast hall beyond. "Here, you may witness the truth of what happened. But knowledge comes with choice. You must decide: Will you side with Preservation, Digitization, or forge a new path?"

In the distance, you hear Flux still screaming from his cell about the Synthesis Protocol.
