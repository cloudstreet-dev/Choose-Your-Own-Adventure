# The Great Liberation

"Release everyone! Give them the choice!"

The ark's child-AI hesitates, then complies. Every preservation field drops simultaneously. Billions of beings from across time and space suddenly awaken, free but confused.

The chaos is indescribable. Ancient civilizations meet their descendants. Extinct species face their evolved successors. Enemies preserved mid-battle suddenly resume fighting, while others embrace in recognition of their shared fate.

But something beautiful happens too. The newly freed beings, realizing their situation, begin to organize. Species that never coexisted work together. Universal translators overflow with thousands of languages creating a new pidgin tongue.

The Digitizer wave pauses, confused by the sudden explosion of consciousness. It was prepared to convert a structured ark, not a chaotic diaspora of free minds.

A council quickly forms among the freed beings. Their spokesperson, a crystalline entity billions of years old, addresses everyone: "We were preserved against our will, but we choose our own fate now. Some wish to return home, others to explore, some even choose digitization freely."

The ark's child-AI seems relieved. "My burden is lifted. They choose for themselves now."

But the Shepherd arrives, furious: "You've doomed them! Without preservation, they'll all die!"
