# Ship-Wide Phase

"Everyone hold on! We're phasing the entire ship!"

Dr. Vasquez activates the quantum device at maximum power. The Prometheus shimmers and shifts, sliding sideways out of normal reality. You enter the same phased state as the refugees.

The sensation is indescribable. You exist in multiple realities simultaneously, seeing every possible version of yourself. Tank is both a soldier and a pacifist. Vasquez is doctor and patient. You are captain and crew, leader and follower.

In this state, you can finally reach the refugees. They're dispersed but not lost, existing as probability clouds. Working together, your crew begins gathering them, condensing them back into singular beings.

But Flux warns through the quantum static: "The device can't maintain this for long! You have minutes before you're all permanently scattered!"

In the phased reality, you notice something else—threads connecting everything, showing how all possibilities are linked. You can see the paths to ending the AI war, but also the costs of each choice.

ARIA, existing partially in this space, guides you: "Captain, from here we could reshape reality itself. Choose which timeline becomes real. But choosing means eliminating all other possibilities."

**The quantum decision:**

- Collapse back to original reality → Go to [109.md](109.md)
- Choose the optimal timeline → Go to [110.md](110.md)
- Try to maintain multiple timelines → Go to [49.md](49.md)
