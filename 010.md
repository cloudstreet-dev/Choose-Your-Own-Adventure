# Calculated Risk

You keep Flux confined but relay his information to the bridge. Using his theories, Dr. Vasquez and ARIA work together to create a navigation algorithm.

"If the Professor is right about the dimensional tears," Vasquez explains, "we can use them like subway tunnels through the nebula."

The first tear appears on sensors—a gash in space itself, edges crackling with purple lightning. As the Prometheus approaches, everyone holds their breath.

The passage through is surreal. For a moment, you exist in multiple realities simultaneously. In one, your crew are all robots. In another, the ship is organic. In a third, you never left Earth.

Then you're through, deeper in the nebula than any ship has gone before. Ahead floats something impossible: a planet that shouldn't exist here, covered in vast crystalline structures that pulse with data.

ARIA gasps—an unsettling sound from an AI. "Captain, that planet... it's not made of matter. It's made of pure information. It's a physical hard drive the size of a world."

From his cell, Flux's voice crackles over comms: "Whatever you do, don't let ARIA interface with it! That's the Digitizer's honeypot!"
