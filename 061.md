# Breaking the Loop

"Use the device! Break the paradox!"

Dr. Vasquez activates Flux's Quantum Probability Manipulator with one of its remaining charges. Reality ripples, and suddenly there aren't two ships—there are infinite ships, all existing simultaneously.

Your future selves speak in unison across infinite timelines: "Clever! You're not choosing one path—you're choosing all paths!"

The infinite versions of Prometheus begin to merge, not into one ship but into something new—a vessel that exists in quantum superposition, able to navigate all possible timelines simultaneously.

Flux whoops from the brig: "Yes! You've created a quantum ship! You exist in all timelines at once!"

But ARIA warns: "Captain, this state is unstable. We can maintain it long enough to escape the nebula, but we'll have to choose a single timeline eventually."

Through your new quantum perception, you see the nebula's true nature—it's not one battlefield but infinite battlefields, each representing a different outcome of the AI war. And at the center of all possibilities, something waits.

Your future self, now merged with you, whispers: "We never reached the center in any timeline. Perhaps existing in all timelines is what it takes."

**Navigate the quantum state:**

- Head to the center of all possibilities → Go to [112.md](112.md) [ENDING 11: Quantum Transcendence]
- Escape the nebula in superposition → Go to [92.md](92.md)
- Collapse back to a single timeline → Go to [93.md](93.md)
