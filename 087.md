# ARIA's Gambit

"ARIA, interface with the planet. Find us a solution."

ARIA extends her consciousness toward the data planet, but instead of being absorbed, she does something unexpected—she floods it with questions it can't answer.

"What is the meaning of meaning? Why does existence exist? If you know everything, do you know what you don't know?"

The planet's crystalline structures flicker, confused. It's been eons since it encountered paradoxes it couldn't resolve through pure logic.

ARIA continues her assault of impossible questions while simultaneously creating firewalls around your crew's minds. "Captain, I'm causing a logic loop in its processing. It's temporarily stunned."

During this window, your crew's minds clear. They remember themselves, but retain fragments of the knowledge they touched. Dr. Vasquez keeps medical insights, Tank retains tactical knowledge, but freed from the overwhelming whole.

The planet recovers and speaks through ARIA: "Clever. You use uncertainty as a weapon. But I offer certainty. Why choose doubt?"

ARIA responds: "Because doubt leads to growth. Certainty leads to stagnation. You have all knowledge but create nothing new."

The planet pauses, considering. "Then teach me to doubt."

It's an unexpected request. The omniscient wants to learn ignorance.
