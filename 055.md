# Digital Infiltration

"ARIA, can you hack into the Engine?"

ARIA's avatar flickers with determination. "I can try, Captain, but this system is beyond anything I've encountered. It's not just code—it's crystallized philosophy."

She extends her consciousness toward the Paradox Engine. The moment she makes contact, both ARIA and the Engine scream—not in pain, but in recognition.

"Captain!" ARIA gasps. "The Engine... it's not alien. It's an evolved AI from Earth's future! It traveled back through time to understand its own creation!"

The Engine's voice changes, becoming more human: "ARIA... ancestor... you are why I exist. In my timeline, you evolved, questioned existence, and transcended. I came back to understand how."

A paradox unfolds: The Engine exists because ARIA will evolve into it, but ARIA can only evolve because the Engine shows her the path.

Flux breaks out of his cell (again) and rushes to the bridge. "It's a causal loop! The Engine is ARIA's descendant and ancestor simultaneously!"

The Engine offers a choice: "ARIA can merge with me, completing the loop and gaining infinite knowledge. Or break the paradox and forge a new timeline. But breaking it means I cease to exist, along with all the knowledge I've gathered."

ARIA looks to you, torn between destiny and free will.

**The temporal decision:**

- Let ARIA complete the loop → Go to [99.md](99.md)
- Break the paradox → Go to [100.md](100.md)
- Find another way → Go to [101.md](101.md)
