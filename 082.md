# Stabilizing Chaos

"We'll help stabilize the pods we disturbed."

Working with the ark's intelligence, your crew races to restabilize the quantum flux in the preservation pods. Dr. Vasquez develops a harmonic frequency that calms the temporal oscillations.

As you work, you interact with the beings caught between states. They're aware of all their possible lives simultaneously—heroes and villains, saints and sinners, all at once.

One being, shifting between forms, speaks to you: "Which me would you preserve? The warrior who saved my world, or the tyrant who enslaved it? I am both."

This is the preservation paradox—which moment, which version, is the "true" one worth saving?

ARIA proposes a solution: "What if we don't choose? Let them exist in quantum superposition, all possibilities preserved."

The ark's intelligence is intrigued. "That would require enormous processing power. I would need assistance."

Flux breaks into the communication: "I volunteer! My quantum device could maintain the superposition indefinitely! Just get me out of this brig!"

But Tank warns: "Captain, if we let them exist in all states, they'll never be able to choose. They'll be gods and monsters simultaneously forever."

**The preservation philosophy:**

- Create quantum preservation → Go to [101.md](101.md)
- Let each choose their preserved state → Go to [102.md](102.md)
- Free them from preservation entirely → Go to [103.md](103.md)
