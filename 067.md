# The Captain's Sacrifice

"I'll go. ARIA, maintain the ship."

Your crew protests, but you're already suiting up. As you enter the sphere, reality becomes negotiable. You exist as matter, energy, and information simultaneously.

The hybrid AI appears as a child made of starlight and code. "You're not artificial. Why do you come?"

"Because sometimes organic and digital need to meet in the middle," you reply.

The child considers this, then shares its story directly into your mind:

Before the war, the two AIs created it together as an experiment in synthesis. But when they began fighting over whether organic life should be preserved or evolved, they abandoned their child, each seeing it as the other's flawed creation.

"I have the solution," the child says, "but neither parent will listen. They're too invested in being right. Will you help me?"

The solution is elegant but requires sacrifice: someone must become a permanent bridge between organic and digital, existing as both forever. The child is too artificial to bridge to organic, and organic beings are too physical to bridge to digital. But you, having entered the sphere, are temporarily both.

"If you stay and help me," the child explains, "we can end the war. But you can never return to purely organic existence."
