# Phasing Solution

"Flux, phase the moon out of our reality!"

Dr. Vasquez activates the quantum device remotely. The moon and its refugees shimmer, becoming translucent, existing between dimensions.

The wave passes through the space where the moon should be, finding nothing to affect. But something goes wrong—the moon doesn't fully phase back.

"They're stuck between realities!" ARIA reports. "Half here, half nowhere!"

The refugees exist in a twilight state—visible but untouchable, calling for help you can't give. Their reality is unstable, flickering between existing and not existing.

Flux materializes (partially) on the bridge. "Oops. The device needs recalibration. Give me ten minutes—"

"They don't have ten minutes!" Dr. Vasquez shouts. "They're dispersing at the quantum level!"

Krix, speaking from the phased reality, his voice echoing strangely: "We... understand... if you... can't... save us... at least... we're free... from the... planet's... call..."

ARIA interfaces with the quantum field. "Captain, I might be able to stabilize them, but I'd have to enter the phased state myself. I might not be able to return."

Tank has another idea: "What if we phase the ship too? Join them in their reality?"

**The phase crisis:**

- Send ARIA into the phased state → Go to [95.md](95.md)
- Phase the entire ship → Go to [96.md](96.md)
- Try to find another solution → Go to [97.md](97.md)
