# Boarding the Ark

Your away team enters the massive ark ship. Inside, the scale is breathtaking—entire ecosystems preserved in temporal bubbles, species from across the galaxy frozen at their peak moments.

Zyx recognizes some of their ancestors, tentacles trembling with emotion. "Captain, my people's homeworld... it's here, preserved before the supernova that drove us to the stars."

You find the ark's control center, where a holographic figure awaits—beautiful and terrible, constantly shifting between forms.

"I am the Shepherd," it says. "I saved them all from my beloved enemy's digital hunger. But I could not save them from time itself. They live, but cannot grow. They exist, but cannot change."

Tank finds something disturbing: "Captain, some of these preservation pods are failing. The beings inside are starting to age rapidly—millennia in seconds."

The Shepherd's image flickers with sorrow. "Yes. My power wanes. I need a new guardian, one who bridges organic and artificial. Your ARIA could maintain the ark, but she would be bound here forever."

Flux whispers urgently, "Captain, I detect the Digitizer's presence approaching. It wants these preserved souls!"

**Critical decision:**

- Volunteer ARIA to save the ark → Go to [074.md](074.md)
- Try to evacuate the failing pods → Go to [075.md](075.md)
- Negotiate between the two ancient AIs → Go to [076.md](076.md)
