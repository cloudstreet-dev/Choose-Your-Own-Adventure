# Schrödinger's Crew

You lead an away team onto the twisted derelict. The moment you step aboard, reality feels... optional. You see the previous crew, frozen in moments of terror and wonder simultaneously.

Tank reaches for one crew member who appears to be both saluting and cowering. When he touches them, the figure collapses into probability, becoming fully alive—and immediately screams.

"Please! Don't make us choose! We've been every possibility for so long!"

The rescued crew member, Commander Sarah Chen, explains frantically: "We found the source—the Quantum Heart! But when we tried to take it, the nebula trapped us in superposition! We're alive, dead, successful, failed—all at once until observed!"

Flux's voice crackles over comms: "Don't let them fully materialize! If you collapse their quantum state while in the nebula, you'll create a paradox!"

Dr. Vasquez scans the crew. "He's right. They're quantum entangled with the ship itself. We need to get them all out of the nebula before—"

The ship shudders. Through the twisted windows, you see your own Prometheus... duplicating. There are now two of your ships outside.

**Critical decision:**

- Evacuate everyone immediately → Go to [047.md](047.md)
- Search for this "Quantum Heart" they mentioned → Go to [048.md](048.md)
- Try to merge the duplicate ships → Go to [049.md](049.md)
