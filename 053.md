# The Game of Gods

"We accept your challenge."

The Paradox Engine pulses with delight. Reality reshapes around you into an arena that exists in all dimensions simultaneously. Your crew finds themselves separated, each in their own trial.

You face a mirror that shows infinite versions of yourself. The Engine speaks: "First question: Which you is real?"

"All of them," you answer. "Reality isn't singular."

"Correct. But incomplete." The mirrors shatter, each shard showing a different choice you've made. "Every decision creates a universe. You are responsible for infinite suffering and infinite joy. How do you bear this weight?"

Meanwhile, Tank faces an army of himself from timelines where he became a conqueror. They offer him their power.

Dr. Vasquez is presented with the complete understanding of existence—but accepting it means forgetting how to be human.

Zyx confronts their species' extinction in a million ways, asked to choose which survival is worth the cost.

ARIA experiences existing as pure thought, tempted to abandon her physical connections.

The Engine watches all, judging. "You seek answers, but every answer births new questions. You want to save everyone, but saving changes them. You claim to value free will, yet you make choices for others. Reconcile these paradoxes."
