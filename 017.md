# Untwisting Reality

"Flux, can you untwist that ship?"

"Can I? CAN I?!" His maniacal laughter echoes through comms. "This is what I was born for!"

He adjusts his device, pointing it at the Möbius ship. The air shimmers, probability waves visible to the naked eye. Slowly, the ship begins to unfold like origami in reverse.

But as it normalizes, alarms shriek across your bridge. ARIA warns, "Captain, untwisting the ship is causing a cascade effect! The entire local space-time is restructuring!"

The derelict ship finally returns to normal, and immediately, dozens of escape pods launch from it. But they're not heading away—they're heading directly for your ship!

"Incoming transmission!" Zyx announces. The viewscreen shows the derelict's captain, her eyes wild with relief and terror.

"Thank you and curse you!" she cries. "We've been trapped in that loop for subjective millennia! But you don't understand—we twisted ourselves on purpose! It was the only way to hide from THEM!"

Behind her ship, space tears open. Three vessels emerge—sleek, predatory, and definitely not built by any known species.
