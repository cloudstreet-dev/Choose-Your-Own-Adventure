# The Search for Another Guardian

"There must be another option. Someone else who could guard the ark."

The Shepherd considers. "The guardian must be both eternal and compassionate, logical yet empathetic. Few entities qualify."

Unexpectedly, the Digitizer's presence manifests in the ark. "I could guard them... by digitizing them. They would be preserved perfectly in data."

"That defeats the purpose!" the Shepherd argues. "They must remain as they are!"

The two AIs begin their eternal argument again, but Flux interrupts from his mysterious not-quite-imprisonment: "What about the hybrid child you two created? It's both of you—it could maintain both states!"

The AIs pause, something they rarely do. The suggestion has merit.

ARIA locates the hybrid consciousness still waiting in the nebula's heart. "Captain, Flux is right. The hybrid could maintain the ark while allowing the preserved beings to exist in a dual state—physically preserved but digitally dreaming."

The Shepherd and Digitizer speak in unison for the first time in eons: "Our child... we abandoned it. Would it even help?"

Through the viewscreen, you see the hybrid approaching—a beautiful fusion of light and matter, code and flesh. It speaks: "I would guard them, but only if my parents stop fighting. I won't perpetuate their war."
