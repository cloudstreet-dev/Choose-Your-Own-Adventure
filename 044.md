# Inside the Ancient Ark

Your team enters the hollow asteroid. Inside, it's bigger than outside—impossible geometry that makes Tank dizzy and Flux ecstatic.

The interior is a vast city, perfectly preserved but empty. Zyx touches a wall, and suddenly, holographic Xephilians appear, going about their daily lives as if nothing happened.

"Recording," ARIA identifies. "No, wait... Captain, these aren't recordings. They're temporal echoes. The Xephilians are here, just phase-shifted out of our timeline."

A figure materializes—solid, unlike the others. It's an ancient Xephilian, but with cybernetic enhancements that look organic.

"Descendant Zyx'theta," it speaks directly to Zyx. "You have returned to claim your inheritance."

Zyx trembles. "Inheritance?"

"We did not vanish," the figure explains. "We transcended. But we left this anchor in realspace for our descendants. You must choose: Activate the Lighthouse and call all Xephilians home to transcendence, or destroy it and let your people forge their own path."

The figure gestures to a massive crystalline core. "But know this—activating the Lighthouse will also awaken something we've been hiding from. The reason we transcended was to escape the Hunger."

Through the walls, you see something stirring in deep space—a darkness that devours light itself.
