# Standing Ground

"All weapons online! We protect the ark!"

The battle against the Digitizer wave is surreal. You're not fighting ships or beings, but pure information trying to convert matter to data. Tank's weapons fire seems effective at first, disrupting the wave's pattern.

The ark's child-AI helps, projecting defensive fields that temporarily solidify the information wave, making it vulnerable to conventional weapons. Together, you create a barrier of resistance.

"It's working!" Dr. Vasquez shouts. But then she notices something troubling. "Captain, we're not destroying the wave—we're absorbing it. Our ship is being slowly digitized from the outside in!"

ARIA confirms: "Hull integrity at 78% physical, 22% digital. We're becoming a hybrid vessel."

The unexpected transformation has benefits—you can now perceive both physical and digital threats, existing partially in both realms. But it also means you're vulnerable to attacks from either state.

The Digitizer speaks through the wave: "You cannot resist forever. Join willingly, and retain your individuality. Resist, and be absorbed namelessly."

The ark's AI makes a desperate suggestion: "Release all the preserved beings at once! Their combined consciousness might overwhelm the wave!"

It's risky—freeing billions simultaneously could cause chaos or create a defensive force.

**Battle decision:**

- Mass release the preserved → Go to [123.md](123.md)
- Continue fighting while transforming → Go to [119.md](119.md)
- Try to redirect the wave elsewhere → Go to [79.md](79.md)
