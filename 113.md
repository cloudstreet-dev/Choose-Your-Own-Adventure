# ENDING 3: The Calculated Peace

You enter the Choice Chamber accepting certainty, knowing your entire future.

The moment you accept certainty, everything becomes clear. You see your entire timeline laid out—every decision, every consequence, every ending. The knowledge is overwhelming but also oddly peaceful.

Tank will die in exactly 14 years, 3 months, and 2 days, saving a colony from raiders. He knows this and accepts it, finding meaning in the certainty of his sacrifice.

Dr. Vasquez will discover the cure for quantum degradation in 7 years, but knows she'll never receive credit. She proceeds anyway, content in the knowledge of her contribution.

Zyx will evolve into a being of pure thought in 23 years, becoming a bridge between realities. They see this transformation and prepare for it with joy.

ARIA calculates the exact sequence of events needed to end the AI war: 1,847 specific actions over 50 years. You begin executing them with mechanical precision.

The universe becomes a clockwork mechanism where free will is an illusion but purpose is absolute. Every action has meaning because you know exactly what it leads to.

The AIs are confused by your transformation. You've achieved what the Weaver wanted—perfect optimization—while maintaining what the Shepherd desired—preservation of purpose.

Your final log, written before you even began: "We traded surprise for meaning. We lost wonder but gained purpose. Was it worth it? The answer was calculated before the question was asked."

**THE END**

*You achieved The Calculated Peace—accepting determinism in exchange for perfect knowledge and purpose.*
