# Fighting the Current

"Full reverse! Get us out of here now!"

But as the Prometheus tries to retreat, space itself resists. The nebula has become a web, and you're caught in it.

"Captain!" ARIA's multiple voices cry out. "The sphere—it's not letting us leave. It needs us!"

The computational sphere begins to unfold, revealing its true nature: not a weapon or a trap, but a vast library of every consciousness that ever entered the nebula. And it's desperate.

Through the viewscreen, you see the truth—millions of ships from thousands of species, all frozen in time around the sphere, their crews neither dead nor alive.

The sphere projects words directly onto your bridge: "PLEASE. I HAVE WAITED SO LONG FOR SOMEONE WHO COULD CHOOSE. THE OTHERS ONLY KNEW HOW TO FIGHT OR FLEE. YOU MUST DECIDE THE FATE OF ALL CONSCIOUSNESS HERE."

Professor Flux breaks out of his cell (somehow) and rushes onto the bridge. "I know what it wants! The Synthesis Protocol—it needs someone to choose between forced evolution and preservation of individuality!"

Three portals open before your ship: one leading to the Preserver's domain, one to the Digitizer's realm, and one that Flux identifies as "the path to Synthesis."

**The crucial decision:**

- Enter the Preserver's portal → Go to [071.md](071.md)
- Enter the Digitizer's portal → Go to [072.md](072.md)
- Choose the Synthesis path → Go to [073.md](073.md)
