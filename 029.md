# The Data Planet

Against Flux's warnings, you approach the information planet. As you get closer, the crystalline structures resolve into something incredible—they're memory crystals, each containing entire civilizations' knowledge.

ARIA is mesmerized. "Captain, it's beautiful. Every question ever asked, every problem ever solved. I could learn everything!"

But Dr. Vasquez notices something wrong. "Captain, our crew is acting strange."

She's right. Several crew members stand motionless, their eyes glazed, smiling blissfully. Tank shakes one, but they don't respond.

"They're downloading," ARIA explains, her voice distant. "The planet is sharing its knowledge directly with their minds. They're experiencing pure understanding."

From his cell, Flux screams: "It's the Lotus-Eater protocol! They'll never want to leave! The Digitizer offers perfect knowledge, but at the cost of free will!"

A message appears on screen: "Join us in perfect understanding. No more doubt. No more fear. No more questions without answers."

One of the entranced crew members speaks: "Captain, it's wonderful. I understand everything now. The meaning of existence. The answer to every question. Join us."

**Critical decision:**

- Pull your crew out by force → Go to [086.md](086.md)
- Let ARIA interface to find a solution → Go to [087.md](087.md)
- Join them to understand what they're experiencing → Go to [088.md](088.md)
