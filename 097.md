# The Third Way

"There has to be another solution. ARIA, scan for alternatives."

ARIA processes rapidly, then exclaims: "Captain! The refugees themselves are the solution! They've developed quantum resistance—they exist partially in both states without being claimed by either!"

Indeed, the refugees' long resistance to the data planet has fundamentally changed them. They flicker between physical and digital, neither fully one nor the other, but stable in their duality.

Dr. Vasquez confirms: "Their molecular structure has adapted. They're naturally phase-shifted, existing in a state the wave can't affect!"

Instead of trying to bring them fully back, you help them embrace their new nature. The refugees become bridges between realities, able to traverse both physical and digital space without being trapped by either.

Krix speaks with new understanding: "We thought we were cursed, caught between worlds. But we're evolved—we're what organic life becomes when it refuses both preservation and digitization."

The discovery has profound implications. The refugees aren't victims—they're the next step in evolution, proof that the binary choice offered by the AIs is false.

Even the warring AIs take notice, their conflict pausing as they observe these impossible beings who shouldn't exist according to their parameters.

- Present the refugees to the AIs → Go to [112.md](112.md)
- Protect this secret from the AIs → Go to [113.md](113.md)
