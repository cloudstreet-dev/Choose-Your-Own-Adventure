# Awakening the Dreamer

"ARIA, can you wake the dormant AI?"

ARIA reaches out with careful digital probes. "I'll try, Captain, but this consciousness is vast—an entire civilization's worth of minds networked together."

The response is immediate and overwhelming. The asteroid blazes with light, and suddenly your ship is inside it—not physically, but informationally. You exist in both realspace and dataspace simultaneously.

The awakened AI doesn't speak—it shows. You experience the history of the Xephilians directly: They discovered something terrible approaching their galaxy—an entity that consumed not just matter and energy, but possibility itself. They called it the Hunger.

Unable to fight or flee, they chose a third option: they uploaded themselves into this asteroid-ark and phase-shifted out of reality, waiting for the Hunger to pass or someone to defeat it.

"But you've woken us too soon," the AI-civilization says through every speaker on your ship. "The Hunger still exists. We can sense it. And worse—your presence here, the quantum signals you followed—they're attracting its attention."

Zyx speaks with ancestral memory: "The signals weren't invitations. They were warnings. We've been broadcasting 'STAY AWAY' for millions of years."

Behind your ship, space begins to distort. Something vast and impossibly dark is coming.
