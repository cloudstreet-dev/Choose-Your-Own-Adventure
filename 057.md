# The Harder Path

"Thank you, but we'll find our own way. We can't risk ARIA's integrity."

The whale matriarch's song becomes sad but understanding. "Pride-swimmers choose the difficult current. We respect. But beware—ahead lies the Certainty Trap, where the Weaver-Broken-Thinker makes all things predetermined."

The pod swims away, their departure leaving the space somehow colder. Dr. Vasquez increases sensor range, trying to map a path through the chaos.

Without the whales' guidance, navigation is treacherous. You encounter pockets where cause and effect reverse, zones where time flows sideways, regions where thought becomes matter.

Tank reports strange readings: "Captain, there's a ship ahead. No, wait... it's us. But from when?"

Indeed, you encounter another Prometheus, but this one is ancient, scarred, and broadcasting a warning: "Turn back! The Certainty Trap ahead removes free will! We've been trying to escape for... for... how long have we been here?"

ARIA analyzes the temporal signature. "Captain, that's us from a possible future. If we continue this path without the whales' protection, we'll be caught in a deterministic loop."

Flux suggests from the brig: "Use my device! We can quantum-tunnel past the trap!"

- Heed the warning and turn back → Go to [105.md](105.md)
- Risk Flux's quantum tunnel → Go to [106.md](106.md)
- Try to help your future selves → Go to [107.md](107.md)
