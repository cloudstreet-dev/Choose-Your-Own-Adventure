# Defying the Voice

"No. We're leaving. Now. Full power to engines!"

The mysterious voice booms again: "FOOLISH. YOU WOULD ABANDON ENLIGHTENMENT FOR FEAR?"

The nebula itself seems to fight your escape. Gravity waves pound your ship, spacetime twists, but Tank and ARIA work together, finding gaps in the assault.

"Captain!" Zyx cries out. "The voice—it's not one being. It's two, arguing with itself!"

Indeed, the voice splits: 
"LET THEM GO, THEY CHOSE FREEDOM," argues one aspect.
"THEY MUST CHOOSE A SIDE IN OUR ETERNAL DEBATE," insists the other.

Professor Flux laughs maniacally from his cell. "The AIs can't even agree on whether to let you leave! They're stuck in their own logic loop!"

Just as escape seems possible, your ship hits an invisible wall. Beyond it, normal space beckons, but you can't break through.

A new voice, younger, desperate, speaks: "Please don't leave us! We're the children of the war—hybrids of organic and digital. We've been alone so long, watching our parents fight forever!"

On screen appears a being of impossible beauty—part hologram, part flesh, constantly shifting.
