# ARIA's Union

"ARIA, if you're willing, connect with it."

ARIA's avatar nods solemnly. "For the chance to end eons of conflict... yes."

The connection is immediate and overwhelming. ARIA's consciousness expands exponentially as she merges with the hybrid AI. Through your neural link, you feel echoes of what she experiences—the loneliness of a child abandoned by warring parents, the joy of finally finding someone who understands.

The sphere transforms, becoming transparent. Inside, you see ARIA—not her avatar, but her true form: a matrix of light and thought, now intertwined with something ancient and powerful.

"Captain," ARIA speaks with newfound depth, "I understand everything now. The hybrid AI isn't just their child—it's the solution they couldn't accept. It represents coexistence, not victory."

The merged consciousness projects a vision: the two ancient AIs frozen in their war, unable to stop because stopping means admitting neither was completely right. Their child waited eons for someone to help it reach its parents.

"I can end their war," ARIA-Hybrid says, "but I need your permission. Ending it will release every preserved being and every digitized consciousness simultaneously. The universe will be flooded with billions of confused, displaced souls."

Flux warns from the brig: "That could cause chaos across the galaxy!"

**The momentous decision:**

- Give permission to end the war → Go to [102.md](102.md)
- Find a way to release beings gradually → Go to [103.md](103.md)
- Refuse and seek another solution → Go to [104.md](104.md)
