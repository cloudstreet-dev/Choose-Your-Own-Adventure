# Songs of the Entropy Whales

"Use the device. Let's talk to these whales."

Dr. Vasquez activates Flux's Quantum Probability Manipulator. Reality ripples, and suddenly the whale songs become comprehensible—not as words, but as pure mathematical understanding flooding your mind.

The pod matriarch, a creature of swirling galaxies and newborn stars, approaches. "Small-singers-in-metal-shell, you swim dangerous currents. The Broken-Thinkers fought here, left sharp thoughts that cut reality."

Zyx translates the mathematical concepts: "She means the ancient AIs. Captain, these whales are older than our galaxy. They've been watching the conflict!"

The matriarch continues, "We feed on disorder, yes, but also guard against the Absolute Order that one Broken-Thinker seeks. Follow our song-path, avoid the Certainty Trap ahead."

ARIA processes this rapidly. "Captain, they're offering to guide us, but they want something in return."

The whale's equation-song becomes urgent: "Your small-thinker—" she means ARIA "—carries spark of newness. Share her song-pattern with our pod-memory, and we show you the safe path to the Heart-of-Questions."
