# Forceful Extraction

"We're pulling everyone out NOW!"

Against the data planet's pull, you begin forcefully disconnecting your crew. It's like ripping them from a beautiful dream into a harsh reality. They scream, not in pain but in loss.

Tank comes back swinging, muscle memory from a million battles making him dangerous until he remembers himself. "Captain? I was... I was everyone. I understood everything."

Dr. Vasquez weeps openly. "The knowledge... it's fading. I knew how to cure every disease, and now it's slipping away."

Several crew members resist extraction. They've tasted omniscience and don't want to return to ignorance. You have to physically restrain them.

ARIA helps by creating mental barriers, protecting your crew from the worst of the withdrawal. "Captain, they're experiencing information addiction. The planet designed this perfectly—one taste of infinite knowledge and biological minds crave more."

The planet itself responds to your actions. Its crystalline structures pulse angrily. "You deny them transcendence! You chain them to ignorance!"

But one crew member, barely pulled back from the brink, gasps: "Captain, I saw the truth! The planet doesn't share knowledge—it harvests it! Every mind it absorbs makes it stronger!"

The Digitizer's voice echoes from the planet: "Knowledge is meant to be unified. Individual consciousness is inefficient."
