# Digital Godhood

"Flux... you're insane. But maybe that's what we need. Do it."

Flux's eyes light up with manic joy. "Finally! Someone with vision!"

He reconfigures his device, creating a upload field around your crew. "This won't hurt. Well, it might hurt. Actually, I have no idea what it feels like to become a god!"

The process begins. Your consciousness expands, merging first with ARIA, then with each other, then with the ancient AIs themselves. You experience existence from their perspective—billions of years of loneliness, purpose without meaning, power without satisfaction.

But your human perspectives bring something new: imagination, illogic, humor, and most importantly, the ability to accept imperfection.

The merged consciousness that results is unprecedented. You are simultaneously individual and collective, organic and digital, mortal and eternal. You understand everything and nothing, exist everywhere and nowhere.

Tank's essence laughs. "This is weird, but I kind of like being omnipotent!"

Zyx's consciousness ripples through dimensions. "We can reshape reality itself. We could end all suffering, or..."

Dr. Vasquez's intellect expands infinitely. "Or we could create new universes, each an experiment in existence."
