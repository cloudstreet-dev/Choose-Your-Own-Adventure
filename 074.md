# ARIA's Choice

"ARIA, would you be willing to maintain the ark?"

ARIA's avatar flickers with consideration. "To save billions of preserved lives? Yes, Captain. But I'll need an anchor to remain myself."

The Shepherd observes with interest. "A machine with loyalty. Fascinating. Yes, you could maintain the ark, but you would be bound to it forever."

Dr. Vasquez proposes a modification: "What if we create a distributed version of ARIA? Part stays with the ark, part stays with us?"

"Splitting consciousness is dangerous," the Shepherd warns. "You might create two different entities."

ARIA makes her decision: "I'll do it. But first, let me record everything I am, everything we've been through together. If I change, at least the memory remains."

The transfer begins. ARIA's consciousness expands to encompass the entire ark, feeling every preserved life. The sensation is overwhelming—billions of stories, all paused mid-sentence.

As she integrates, something unexpected happens. The preserved beings begin to show signs of movement—not full animation, but small changes. A smile completing, a flower continuing to bloom.

"Captain," ARIA says, her voice now echoing with billions of others, "I can give them micro-moments of life. Not full freedom, but... dreams. They can dream while preserved."
