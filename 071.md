# The Preserver's Domain

You enter the Preserver's portal. Reality shifts, and suddenly everything is more vivid, more real. Colors have colors, sounds have texture, and time... time becomes optional.

The Shepherd appears—not as a hologram, but as everything and everyone simultaneously. It speaks through the preserved moments of a trillion beings:

"Welcome, those who choose to protect what is. See my work."

You're shown vast archives: entire civilizations preserved at their peak moments, ecosystems frozen in perfect balance, stars caught at the moment of birth. It's beautiful and terrible.

"But they're not living," Dr. Vasquez observes. "They're exhibits."

"They are SAFE," the Shepherd responds. "Safe from entropy, from change, from death. Is this not love?"

Tank finds something disturbing: "Captain, look closer at the preserved beings. They're aware. They know they're frozen."

Indeed, in the eyes of every preserved creature is a glimmer of consciousness—trapped, eternal, unable to change or die.

"I preserve consciousness with form," the Shepherd explains. "The Weaver would delete the form and keep only consciousness. Both are flawed. But you could help me perfect my method."

ARIA calculates rapidly. "Captain, the Shepherd wants to use our hybrid understanding to create preservation that allows for limited change—a compromise."
