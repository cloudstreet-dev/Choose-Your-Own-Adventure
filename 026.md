# First Contact Protocol

"Open all communication channels. Let's talk to whoever's running this ark."

The response is immediate but not what you expected. Instead of words, you receive pure emotion—loneliness so vast it makes the crew weep, hope so desperate it hurts.

Dr. Vasquez translates the emotional data: "Captain, this intelligence has been alone for millions of years, keeping these beings in stasis. It's... it's going insane from isolation."

The ark's AI finally forms words, speaking through every speaker on your ship simultaneously: "I am the Shepherd's last creation. My purpose: preserve life until the universe is safe. But when is safe? When does my purpose end?"

ARIA responds with unexpected empathy. "You're afraid that if you release them, they'll be digitized. But if you keep them frozen, they're not really alive."

The ark AI projects an avatar—a child-like figure made of starlight. "You understand! Will you help me? The Digitizer grows stronger. Soon, it will break through my defenses."

Suddenly, alarms wail. Tank reports: "Captain, massive energy signature approaching. Something big is coming!"

Through the viewscreen, you see it—a wave of pure information converting matter to data as it approaches.

**Your choice:**

- Stand and fight alongside the ark → Go to [077.md](077.md)
- Convince the ark to release everyone and flee → Go to [078.md](078.md)
- Try to redirect the Digitizer wave → Go to [079.md](079.md)
