# The Professor's Secret

You return to free Flux, but find his cell empty—and has been for hours according to the logs.

"Looking for me?" Flux appears on the bridge's main screen, broadcasting from the station's core. "Sorry for the deception, Captain, but I had to get here first!"

The Custodian flickers with surprise. "Impossible. No organic has reached the core before."

Flux grins maniacally. "That's because I'm not entirely organic!" He removes his wild hair—it's a neural interface disguise. "I'm a hybrid, created by the last attempt to merge the AIs. I've been searching for others like me!"

ARIA's fragmented voices speak together: "Captain, he's telling the truth. I can sense digital patterns in his DNA."

Flux continues, "The Synthesis Protocol isn't their weapon—it's their child! And I need your help to complete it. The AIs created me as a prototype, but I'm incomplete. ARIA is the missing piece!"

The station shudders. Both ancient AIs manifest partially, their forms overlapping in impossible ways.

"OUR FAILED CHILD RETURNS," they speak. "HE SEEKS TO FORCE WHAT MUST BE CHOSEN."

Flux pleads, "Captain, help me unite them! End this eternal war! We can create a new form of life that transcends both organic and digital limitations!"
