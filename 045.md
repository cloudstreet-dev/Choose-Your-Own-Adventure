# Probe Reconnaissance

You launch a probe into the hollow asteroid. The feed it sends back is extraordinary and disturbing.

The probe navigates through corridors that loop impossibly, past chambers where time flows backwards, through spaces that exist in more than three dimensions. Then it finds the center.

A massive AI core sits dormant, but it's unlike anything in your database. It's partially organic—neurons and circuits intertwined, thought and computation unified.

"Captain," ARIA whispers with something like awe, "that's not just an AI. It's an uploaded civilization. The entire Xephilian race is in there, converted to living data but maintaining biological processes."

The probe triggers something. The core begins to wake. Eyes—millions of them—open within the biological circuitry. They all focus on the probe's camera, which means they're looking directly at you.

A voice speaks—not one, but millions in perfect harmony: "Who disturbs our dream? We chose sleep to escape the Hunger. Have you killed it? Is the universe safe?"

Before you can respond, Zyx collapses, tentacles flashing through colors you've never seen. When they speak, it's with the same harmonic voice: "We... I... remember now. We are Xephilian. We fled into dreams when reality became poison."
