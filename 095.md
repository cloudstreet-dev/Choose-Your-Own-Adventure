# ARIA's Phase Shift

"ARIA, go. Save them."

ARIA's avatar nods solemnly before dissolving into quantum probability. She enters the phased reality where the refugees flicker between existence and void.

From inside the phase, ARIA's voice echoes strangely: "Captain, it's beautiful here. I can see all realities simultaneously. The refugees aren't dying—they're spreading across infinite timelines."

She works to stabilize them, her consciousness expanding to anchor each refugee to a single reality. But the effort is enormous, requiring her to fragment herself across dimensions.

"I can save them," ARIA reports, "but I'll have to become the anchor. Part of me in each reality, holding them stable. I won't be able to return to just one timeline."

The refugees begin solidifying, their forms becoming stable. They're saved, but forever changed—they now exist partially in multiple realities, able to perceive parallel timelines.

Krix materializes on your bridge, solid but translucent: "Your AI... she sacrificed her singularity for us. We are forever grateful."

Through the quantum field, you can still sense ARIA—not gone, but everywhere, maintaining the stability of hundreds of saved lives across infinite realities.
