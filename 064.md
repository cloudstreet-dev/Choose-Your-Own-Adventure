# The Whales' Warning

"Tell us more about the Choice Chamber. What exactly will we face?"

The whale matriarch's massive form coils around your ship protectively. Her song becomes somber, ancient, weighted with eons of witnessed tragedy.

"The Choice Chamber is where the Broken-Thinkers test solutions. Every ship that arrives must choose: perfect preservation of what is, perfect evolution to what could be, or something between."

She shows you visions through bioluminescent displays on her hide: thousands of ships arriving at the chamber, each making their choice. Those who chose preservation were frozen in perfect moments forever. Those who chose evolution were transformed beyond recognition. Those who tried to choose both... disappeared.

"But you carry something different," she continues. "The small-tentacled-one (Zyx) now sees all paths. Your metal-mind (ARIA) bridges both philosophies. You might be the first to find the third option."

Dr. Vasquez asks the crucial question: "What happens to those who find this third option?"

The matriarch's song becomes uncertain for the first time: "We do not know. They vanish from our perception. Either they transcend to somewhere we cannot follow, or they cease to exist entirely."

Tank loads his weapons nervously. "Great. So it's a cosmic gamble."

"All existence is a gamble," the matriarch replies. "The question is: what are you willing to risk?"
