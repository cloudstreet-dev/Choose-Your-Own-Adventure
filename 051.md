# First Contact Protocols

"Hold fire! Open communications!"

Tank reluctantly powers down weapons as you broadcast universal peace signals. The alien ships respond with something unexpected—laughter. Not malicious, but genuinely amused laughter translated through your systems.

The lead ship's captain appears on screen—a crystalline being whose body refracts light into rainbow patterns. "Finally! Someone who doesn't immediately shoot! We are the Observers. We've been waiting eons for a species mature enough to talk first."

The derelict captain gasps. "Impossible! You attacked us!"

The Observer chuckles, a sound like wind chimes. "No, you attacked your own shadow. The time-loop created temporal echoes. You've been fighting your own past and future selves for subjective centuries."

They show you recordings—the derelict ship firing on itself across time loops, creating the very enemy they feared.

"We're here to help," the Observer continues. "The quantum disturbance in this nebula is spreading. Soon it will consume your galaxy. But you—" they point at your crew, "—you have something unique. An AI that can navigate quantum space, and organic minds flexible enough to accept paradox."

Flux yells from the brig: "They're lying! They want to use us!"

The Observer sighs. "The paranoid one is partially correct. We do need you, but for mutual benefit."
