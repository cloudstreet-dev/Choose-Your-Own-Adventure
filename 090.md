# Maximum Evacuation

You push the evacuation to the absolute limit. Every second counts as more refugees crush aboard. The Prometheus groans under the weight of far too many beings.

"Seven hundred... eight hundred..." Tank counts desperately. "Captain, the ship can't take more!"

But still they come. Parents pushing children forward, elderly staying behind so young can escape. The heroism and tragedy are overwhelming.

With thirty seconds until the wave hits, you're forced to close the doors. The left behind don't blame you—they understand. Some even smile, finally free from the constant fight against the planet's pull, accepting their fate.

As the Prometheus struggles to lift off, overloaded and sluggish, the wave hits the data planet. The gravitational surge is massive. The moon cracks, begins to break apart.

"We're too heavy!" ARIA warns. "We can't achieve escape velocity!"

Dr. Vasquez has an idea: "The refugees who've been resisting—they've developed mental defenses. If they combine their resistance, they might create a psychic shield!"

Krix understands immediately, organizing the refugees. Hundreds of minds that learned to resist digitization work together, creating a barrier of pure will against the wave's pull.

It works, barely. The ship breaks free as the moon shatters below.
