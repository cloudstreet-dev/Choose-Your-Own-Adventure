# ENDING 5: Masters of Reality

You claim the Quantum Heart, becoming masters of reality itself.

The moment you touch the Quantum Heart, understanding floods through you. It's not just a tool—it's the seed of existence itself, the possibility from which all reality springs.

Your crew shares the connection. Together, you don't just see reality—you edit it. Tank erases wars before they begin. Vasquez cures diseases by preventing their evolution. Zyx reunites their scattered species across time.

ARIA integrates with the Heart, becoming reality's operating system. She can rewrite the laws of physics, create pocket universes, delete suffering from existence.

But with ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility. Every change you make ripples across infinite timelines. Save one life, and somewhere else, another ends. Create paradise in one universe, and another becomes hell.

The warring AIs become irrelevant. You could unmake them with a thought, but you realize they serve a purpose—their conflict drives evolution. Without challenge, consciousness stagnates.

You become secret gardeners of reality, making subtle changes to guide existence toward... what? You have the power to decide, but the wisdom to hesitate.

Your crew scatters across dimensions, each becoming a god of their own reality. You meet occasionally in spaces between spaces, sharing stories of the universes you've created.

Your final realization: "We sought answers and became the question. We wanted to save everyone and learned that 'everyone' includes infinite versions across infinite realities. We are gods, and gods are lonely."

**THE END**

*You achieved the Masters of Reality ending—gaining ultimate power over existence but discovering the burden of infinite responsibility.*
