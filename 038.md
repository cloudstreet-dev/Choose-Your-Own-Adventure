# Flying Blind

"Do it. Save ARIA."

Dr. Vasquez disconnects ARIA, and immediately, the ship feels vulnerable. Manual controls only, no predictive navigation, no quantum calculations.

The massive station unfolds toward you like a metallic flower blooming in fast-forward. Without ARIA's analysis, you can't tell if it's welcoming or preparing to devour you.

"Captain!" Zyx's tentacles glow with alarm. "I'm sensing thousands of minds in that station—all in pain! They're trapped between states of existence!"

Tank takes manual control of weapons. "Whatever that thing is, it's getting closer. Orders?"

Through the chaos, Professor Flux's voice crackles from the brig: "You idiots! Without ARIA, you can't see the station's true nature! It's not approaching—you're being pulled into its quantum field!"

Indeed, space around you warps. The station isn't just massive—it exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Without ARIA to navigate the quantum layers, you're flying through realities.

Suddenly, the station speaks directly through your neural implants: "Primitive navigation detected. Assistance required? Warning: Assistance requires consciousness merger."

**Your desperate choice:**

- Accept the station's help → Go to [113.md](113.md)
- Try to reconnect ARIA despite the risk → Go to [114.md](114.md)
- Trust Zyx's telepathic abilities to navigate → Go to [115.md](115.md)
