# Entering the Crimson Storm

You order the ship forward, ignoring the stowaway situation. The Prometheus shudders as it enters the nebula's crimson clouds. Reality seems to bend—colors that shouldn't exist paint themselves across the viewscreen.

"Captain!" Dr. Vasquez shouts. "Our instruments are going haywire! I'm reading our ship in seven different locations simultaneously!"

ARIA's voice distorts: "Căpt̷ai̶n̷... temporal f̵r̶a̴c̶t̵u̷r̷e̶s detec̸t̵e̴d̶... I'm experiencing parallel processing across multiple timelines..."

Through the chaos, Zyx's tentacles suddenly stiffen. "Captain, I'm receiving a telepathic signal! There's something alive in here—something vast and ancient!"

The viewscreen flickers, showing a massive structure hidden in the nebula's heart: a space station the size of a moon, constructed from impossible geometries.

Tank reports: "That stowaway is banging on his cell door, screaming about 'The Synthesis Protocol'—whatever that means."
