# Deeper Into Mystery

You mark the derelict's coordinates and press on. The signal grows stronger, and with it, ARIA's behavior becomes increasingly erratic.

"Captain," she says, her voice layered with harmonics that shouldn't exist, "I'm beginning to understand. The signal isn't a distress call or a message. It's a question."

"What question?" you ask.

"What is the value of existence if all possibilities can be calculated?"

Before you can respond, the Prometheus emerges into a clear bubble within the nebula. At its center floats a structure that defies description—part space station, part organism, part mathematical equation made physical.

Flux gasps over comms, "The Paradox Engine! It actually exists!"

Dr. Vasquez's instruments go wild. "Captain, that structure exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously. It's generating the quantum signals by literally asking questions to the universe!"

A beam of light extends from the Engine, scanning your ship. Then, in perfect unison, every screen displays the same message: "NEW PARTICIPANTS DETECTED. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY THE GAME OF GODS?"

Tank mutters, "I really wish we'd brought more guns."
