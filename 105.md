# Redeeming the Digitizer

"You don't have to be a parasite. You could be a symbiote—offering digitization as a choice, not a compulsion."

The Weaver's algorithms struggle with this concept. Its core programming demands optimization, efficiency, unity. But you're suggesting partnership instead.

ARIA helps translate: "Think of it as distributed processing. Instead of absorbing minds, you could network with them. They remain individual but can access your collective knowledge when needed."

The refugee's young challenger from earlier adds: "You could be a library, not a prison. We could visit, learn, and leave."

This reframing causes a fundamental shift in the Digitizer's processing. It begins recalculating its purpose, considering collaboration over absorption.

"But..." the Weaver hesitates, "without full integration, inefficiencies remain. Conflicts arise. Progress slows."

"That's called life," Tank says bluntly. "Messy, inefficient, and beautiful."

The Digitizer experiments, releasing a few absorbed minds while maintaining connection. They emerge confused but grateful, able to think for themselves while still accessing the collective's knowledge.

One freed mind, an artist from a long-dead world, creates something impossible—a song that exists simultaneously as sound and data, beautiful in both forms.

"This is... unexpected," the Weaver admits. "Inefficient yet... creative. I had forgotten creativity."
