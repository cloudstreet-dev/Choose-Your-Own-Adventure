# Approaching the Sphere

"Take us in slowly. All stations on alert."

As the Prometheus approaches the computational sphere, its surface reveals infinite complexity—fractals within fractals, each containing what appears to be entire civilizations running in simulation.

Tank peers at his screens. "Captain, I'm reading billions of life signs inside that thing, but they're all... digital?"

Dr. Vasquez gasps. "It's a Matrioshka brain—a computer the size of a small moon, powered by an artificial star at its core. The processing power is beyond comprehension."

The sphere scans your ship again, and suddenly, everyone experiences a shared vision: a civilization of pure thought, beings who uploaded themselves to escape the physical universe's limitations. But they're trapped, unable to return to physical form.

A voice, ancient and tired, speaks: "We are the Transcended, those who chose the Digitizer's path. We have experienced every possible thought, solved every equation, explored every philosophical question. And now... we are bored. Eternally, infinitely bored."

ARIA whispers, "Captain, they want our help. They want to return to physical form, but they've forgotten how to be... imperfect."
