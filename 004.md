# Interrogation in the Brig

You meet Professor Flux in the holding cell. He's somehow already decorated it with equations scrawled on the walls using what appears to be pudding from his lunch.

"Ah, Captain! Coming to pick my brain? Good, good! But we're wasting time!" He points at his equations. "The Crimson Nebula isn't just a space phenomenon—it's a scar in reality itself, torn open by an ancient AI war!"

"AI war?" you ask, noticing ARIA's avatar flicker with interest.

"Yes! Two godlike artificial intelligences fought here eons ago. One sought to preserve all life, the other to digitize it. Their battle tore holes in spacetime!" Flux's eyes widen. "The signals you're following? They're distress calls from ships caught between dimensions!"

ARIA processes this information. "Captain, if he's correct, we might be walking into an active battlefield frozen in time."

Tank's voice crackles over comms: "Captain, we're approaching the nebula's edge. I'm reading massive gravitational anomalies."
