# Merging Paradox

"If there are two ships, we merge them back together!"

Dr. Vasquez thinks you're insane, but Flux's excited voice crackles over comms: "Brilliant! Fight paradox with paradox!"

You order both Prometheus ships to occupy the same space. The maneuver should be impossible, but in the quantum chaos of the nebula, impossible is just another word for Tuesday.

The merger is surreal. You experience being in two places at once, making different decisions simultaneously. Your crew doubles, then halves, then becomes something in between.

When it completes, your ship has changed. It exists partially in multiple dimensions, able to phase between realities at will. The superpositioned crew from the derelict are now stable—neither fully collapsed nor spread across possibilities, but something new.

Commander Chen, now stable, explains: "The Quantum Heart taught us something. Reality isn't binary—real or unreal, alive or dead. There are infinite states between."

Your enhanced ship can now see the nebula's true nature: it's not just a battlefield, it's a nursery. The AIs aren't just fighting—they're creating new forms of existence through their conflict.

ARIA, evolved by the merger, reports: "Captain, I can navigate quantum space now. We can go anywhere, anywhen. But each jump risks creating more paradoxes."
