# Selective Return

"We help only those who truly want physical form. The others remain digital by choice."

The process becomes a triage of consciousness. Dr. Vasquez sets up evaluation protocols, determining which minds genuinely desire return versus those acting on impulse or confusion.

The diversity is stunning. Some beings have been digital so long they've forgotten what physical sensation means. Others cling desperately to memories of taste, touch, and pain—yes, even pain is missed.

You help a poet who misses the feeling of rain. A warrior who wants to feel the weight of armor again. A parent who just wants to hold their child, even though that child digitized centuries ago.

Each return is unique. Some emerge in bodies similar to their original forms. Others, having been digital so long, manifest as hybrid beings—part flesh, part living data.

The Transcended watch with fascination. Those who choose to return become ambassadors between realms, able to speak both languages of existence.

But controversy arises. Some who return regret it immediately—physical form means pain, aging, death. They demand re-digitization, but the process has changed them. They can never be purely digital again.
