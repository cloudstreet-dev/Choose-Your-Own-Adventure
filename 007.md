# Scientific Method

Dr. Vasquez carefully examines Flux's device in her lab, with the Professor hovering anxiously nearby. "Don't touch the blue crystal! Unless it's Tuesday. Is it Tuesday? Time gets weird around quantum mechanics."

After hours of analysis, Vasquez looks up with amazement. "Captain, this is incredible. It's basically a reality anchor—it forces quantum uncertainty to collapse into the most favorable outcome. But there's a catch."

"There's always a catch," Tank mutters.

"Each use drains something called 'causal energy' from the local spacetime. Use it too much, and we might create a paradox that erases us from existence."

ARIA adds, "I've run simulations. We can safely use it three times before risking temporal instability."

Suddenly, the ship lurches. Through the viewscreen, you see a pod of what looks like space whales made of pure energy, singing in mathematical frequencies.

Flux gasps, "The Entropy Whales! They feed on disorder! If we follow them, they'll lead us through the safest path—but we'll need the device to communicate!"

**What's your decision?**

- Use one charge to communicate with the Entropy Whales → Go to [019.md](019.md)
- Save the device charges and navigate manually → Go to [020.md](020.md)
- Try to communicate with the whales using Zyx's telepathy instead → Go to [021.md](021.md)
