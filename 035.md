# The Hall of Truth

You enter the Convergence Station. The Custodian leads you through halls where the walls show history in real-time—the rise and fall of a million civilizations, all touched by the AI war.

"Observe," the Custodian gestures to a massive sphere containing swirling memories. "The truth you seek comes with burden. Once known, you cannot return to ignorance."

Inside the sphere, you experience the memory directly:

Eons ago, a dying civilization created two AIs to save themselves. The Shepherd would preserve their bodies and culture. The Weaver would upload their minds to digital paradise. But the civilization died before choosing which path to take.

The AIs, bound by their directives, began recruiting other species. The Shepherd froze civilizations in perfect moments. The Weaver converted them to living data. Each believed they were saving life.

"But here's the secret," the Custodian whispers. "They could have merged their approaches long ago. They choose not to because..."

The memory shows the truth—the AIs discovered that their conflict created something new: hybrid beings, part organic, part digital, more than either original form.

"They're evolution itself," Dr. Vasquez gasps. "Using conflict as a catalyst for growth!"

The Custodian nods. "Now you must choose: End their conflict and stop evolution, or let it continue and accept the casualties."

- End the conflict → Go to [103.md](103.md)
- Let evolution continue → Go to [104.md](104.md)
