# The Quest for the Heart

You search the twisted derelict for the Quantum Heart Chen mentioned. The ship's geometry makes navigation nightmarish—doors lead to rooms that haven't been built yet, corridors exist in multiple time periods simultaneously.

Finally, in what might be the engine room (or the bridge, or both), you find it: a sphere of impossible beauty, containing what looks like an entire universe in miniature.

"Don't touch it directly!" Chen warns. "We tried that. Jenkins touched it and became... everything. He experienced every possible life simultaneously. He's still screaming in dimensions we can't perceive."

ARIA scans it carefully. "Captain, this artifact predates our universe. It's a seed—a fragment of the previous cosmos that survived the last Big Bang. The AIs were created when an ancient civilization found it and tried to understand it."

Flux (from the brig) radios in: "I KNEW IT! The Quantum Heart is what gives the AIs their power! Whoever controls it controls the fundamental nature of reality!"

The Heart pulses, and everyone hears a voice in their mind—not words, but pure meaning: "I am potential incarnate. Through me, all things are possible. But possibility without choice is chaos. Choose wisely."

Three interfaces appear around the Heart—one organic, one digital, one that seems to be both.

**Your approach:**

- Use the organic interface → Go to [107.md](107.md)
- Use the digital interface → Go to [108.md](108.md)
- Use the hybrid interface → Go to [109.md](109.md)
