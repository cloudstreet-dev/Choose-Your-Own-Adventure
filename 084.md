# Breaking Free

"We're leaving. The paradox ends here."

As you power up the engines, the colony begins to flicker. Your descendants/ancestors plead with you not to go, but you're determined to break free from temporal prison.

"If we leave, you'll cease to exist," the elderly Tank's grandmother warns.

"No," ARIA interjects, having analyzed the situation. "They'll cease to exist in this timeline. But somewhere, in another branch of reality, the colony continues."

The philosophical weight is heavy—by leaving, you're potentially erasing billions of lives that span centuries. But staying means accepting a predetermined fate.

As the Prometheus pulls away, reality fractures. You see multiple versions of the colony—one where you stayed, one where you never arrived, one where you arrive in the future instead of now.

Tank makes a crucial observation: "Captain, look at the quantum signals. They're not disappearing—they're multiplying!"

Indeed, your rejection of the paradox has created multiple timelines, each sending their own signals. What was one mystery has become infinite mysteries.

Dr. Vasquez detects something else: "Captain, we're not just leaving the colony. We're leaving normal spacetime. We've become untethered from casual reality!"

Your ship now exists between timelines, able to see all possibilities but belonging to none.
