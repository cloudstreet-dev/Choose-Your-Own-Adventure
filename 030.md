# Heeding the Warning

You trust Flux's warning and steer clear of the data planet. As you pass, you see something horrifying—derelict ships orbiting it, their crews still aboard, standing at their posts with blissful smiles, connected to the planet by streams of light.

"Thank god you listened!" Flux's voice crackles. "That's the Digitizer's recruitment center. It doesn't force conversion—it makes beings WANT to join."

ARIA observes the planet receding. "I felt its pull, Captain. The promise of infinite knowledge. Part of me still wants to go back."

Navigating around the planet reveals something else—a debris field of destroyed ships, all bearing weapons. Tank analyzes them: "These ships tried to attack the planet. Looks like it has defenses."

Beyond the data planet, you discover something unexpected: a small moon, hidden in its shadow, covered in refugee camps.

A transmission comes through: "Unknown vessel, are you... are you still organic? Please, we're survivors who resisted the Call. We've been hiding here for decades!"

The camp leader, an insectoid being named Krix, explains: "We're the ones who pulled away in time. But we can't leave—the planet's gravity well is also a mental trap. The longer we stay, the harder it becomes to resist."
