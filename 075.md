# Emergency Evacuation

"We're getting everyone we can out of those failing pods!"

The rescue operation is chaos. As preserved beings are freed, they experience time catching up—some age years in seconds, others remain frozen in their last moment. The ark groans under the strain of selective liberation.

Tank coordinates the evacuation with military precision. "Teams of three! Grab the pods showing red indicators first!"

You save hundreds, but for each being freed, the preservation field weakens further. The Shepherd watches with something like sadness.

"You doom them to entropy," it says. "They were eternal. Now they will die."

An elderly alien you just freed grabs your arm. "Thank you," she wheezes, aging rapidly. "Better one day of freedom than eternity in amber."

Zyx discovers something crucial: "Captain! The preservation field is powered by the preserved consciousness! Freeing them weakens the field, but it also—"

The ark shudders. Without enough preserved minds to sustain it, the entire structure begins to collapse. Millions of beings still trapped inside face either freedom or destruction.

Dr. Vasquez shouts over the chaos: "We can save them all, but we need a new power source for the ark!"

ARIA calculates rapidly: "The Prometheus's core could sustain it for approximately twelve hours. Enough time to evacuate everyone, but we'd be stranded."
