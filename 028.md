# The Original Mission

You decide to ignore the mysterious signals and stick to your original colony mission. The crew seems relieved—finally, something normal.

Three months pass peacefully as you travel to the designated colony world, New Eden. But as you approach, ARIA detects something odd.

"Captain, New Eden is already inhabited. There's a fully functioning colony that's been here for... 200 years? But that's impossible. We're the first colony ship."

Landing reveals the truth—the colonists are all humans, but they claim to be descendants of your crew. An elderly woman approaches, and Tank gasps. "That's... that's my grandmother. But older. And she died years ago!"

She smiles sadly. "Commander Morrison. You finally made it. We've been waiting for you to complete the loop."

The colony's leader explains: "You haven't ignored the signals, Captain. You've been following them all along. Those quantum signatures? They were sent by us, your descendants, from inside a temporal loop. New Eden exists in a pocket of folded spacetime."

ARIA calculates rapidly. "Captain, if we stay, we'll create the very colony that sent us the signals. But if we leave..."

"The colony ceases to exist," the leader finishes. "We're a temporal paradox. We only exist because you choose to create us."

**The paradoxical choice:**

- Stay and complete the time loop → Go to [083.md](083.md)
- Leave and break the paradox → Go to [084.md](084.md)
- Try to understand how this happened first → Go to [085.md](085.md)
