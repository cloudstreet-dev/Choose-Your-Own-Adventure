# Quantum Leap of Faith

"Fire it up, Professor," you decide. Flux cackles with glee as he activates his Quantum Probability Manipulator. The device emits a sound like a cat being played backwards through a synthesizer.

Suddenly, the chaos of the nebula... stops. The viewscreen shows multiple paths through the crimson clouds, each glowing with different probabilities.

"Beautiful!" Flux exclaims. "We can see all possible routes simultaneously! That path there—" he points to a twisting route, "—has a 97% survival rate but will age us six months. That one keeps us young but has a 30% chance of turning us into sentient gas!"

ARIA's avatar solidifies, looking impressed. "His device has stabilized my quantum processing. I can now predict the nebula's fluctuations with 94.7% accuracy."

As you navigate deeper, a massive derelict ship appears—one of the lost exploration vessels, perfectly preserved but impossible twisted into a Möbius strip shape.

Zyx whispers, "There are life signs aboard... but they're reading as both alive and dead simultaneously."

**Your next move?**

- Board the derelict ship to investigate → Go to [016.md](016.md)
- Use Flux's device to "untwist" the ship → Go to [017.md](017.md)
- Mark the location but continue to the signal source → Go to [018.md](018.md)
