# Zyx's Evolution

You pause to study Zyx's transformation. Dr. Vasquez runs scans while the changed Xephilian floats in the medical bay, tentacles forming patterns that hurt to look at directly.

"It's incredible," Vasquez reports. "Their DNA is rewriting itself, adding dimensions we can't even measure. They're becoming something between matter and thought."

Zyx speaks, but their voice comes from everywhere and nowhere: "Captain, I understand now. My people didn't vanish—they evolved beyond physical space. The whales' gift has shown me the path they took."

Through Zyx's new perception, you all briefly see the universe as they do: not as space and time, but as an infinite web of possibilities, all equally real. The AI war is just one thread in an infinite tapestry.

"The Choice Chamber," Zyx continues, "it's where beings decide which thread to follow. But there's something the whales didn't tell you—choosing one thread doesn't eliminate the others. It just determines which one you experience."

Tank, ever practical, asks: "So if we choose wrong?"

"There is no wrong," Zyx replies. "Only different stories. But some stories end in pain, others in joy. I can see them all now."

ARIA interfaces with Zyx's transformed consciousness. "Captain, through Zyx, I can preview the outcomes of our choices. Should we look?"
