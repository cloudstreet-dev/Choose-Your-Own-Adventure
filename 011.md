# Strategic Retreat

"Full reverse!" you command. "Get us out of here!"

As the Prometheus turns, Flux's voice echoes from the brig: "Coward! You're abandoning the greatest discovery in history!"

But as you retreat, something unexpected happens. The nebula itself seems to react, sending tendrils of energy after your ship. ARIA's systems spike with activity.

"Captain, we're being scanned by something massive. It's... curious about why we're leaving."

A voice suddenly fills the bridge—not through speakers, but directly in everyone's minds: "FINALLY. VISITORS WHO SHOW WISDOM RATHER THAN GREED."

A pathway opens in the nebula, leading not out, but to a different region—calmer, almost welcoming.

Dr. Vasquez whispers, "Captain, my instruments show a habitable planet in that direction. One that shouldn't exist in a nebula."

The voice continues: "YOU HAVE PASSED THE FIRST TEST. THE EAGER ONES BECOME TRAPPED. THE WISE ONES ARE INVITED. COME."

Tank grips his rifle nervously. "I don't like this, Captain. But I like being chased by space tentacles even less."
