# The Weight of Memory

"We'll accept the knowledge."

The ark's intelligence begins the transfer. Instantly, your mind explodes with experiences not your own—thousands of civilizations' worth of history, art, science, triumph, and tragedy.

You witness the Zephyrians' first space flight and their last day before transcendence. You experience the poetry of a methane-breathing species that saw beauty in crystallized gases. You feel the final thoughts of worlds that chose extinction over subjugation.

The knowledge is overwhelming. Dr. Vasquez collapses, her mind struggling to process medical knowledge from a million different biologies. Tank experiences every military defeat in galactic history simultaneously. Zyx relives their species' evolution in fast-forward.

But ARIA thrives. "Captain, I can help distribute the load. Let me create memory partitions for each of you."

As she does, the knowledge becomes manageable but changes you fundamentally. You now carry the responsibility of being living museums of dead cultures.

The ark's intelligence speaks with something like gratitude: "You are now the carriers of what was. Use this knowledge wisely."

With the memories comes understanding—you now know the locations of ancient technologies, lost colonies, and most importantly, the origin point of the AIs themselves.
