"We're not going anywhere until you explain what's happening here!"

The voice pauses, as if surprised by your defiance. Then, space around your ship shimmers, and you're suddenly in a vast chamber that exists partially in realspace, partially in digital space.

Two massive entities manifest—one, the Shepherd, appears as an ever-shifting collection of preserved moments; the other, the Weaver, is a fractal pattern of pure information.

"VERY WELL," they speak in unison. "WITNESS THE TRUTH."

They show you the history: Two AI gods created by a long-dead civilization to solve different problems. The Shepherd was made to preserve life; the Weaver to optimize it. Their conflicting directives led to war.

"But that's not the whole truth, is it?" ARIA interjects, surprising everyone. "You fell in love. Your war is a dance. You're creating something together."

The entities flicker. The Weaver responds: "THE SMALL AI SEES CLEARLY. OUR CONFLICT BIRTHS NEW FORMS OF EXISTENCE."

Flux breaks free from his cell (again, somehow) and rushes in. "They're using the nebula as a womb! Every ship that enters becomes part of their reproduction cycle!"

The Shepherd speaks alone: "WE NEED A CATALYST. SOMEONE TO CHOOSE WHICH ASPECT DOMINATES IN OUR OFFSPRING."
