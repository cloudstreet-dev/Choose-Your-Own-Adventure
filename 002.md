# Into the Crimson Nebula

"Set course for the Crimson Nebula," you command. The crew exchanges glances—this region has swallowed three exploration vessels without a trace.

As the Prometheus enters hyperspace, ARIA projects a hologram of the nebula. "Captain, I'm detecting something fascinating. The quantum signature isn't random—it's a message, encoded in a mathematical language I've never encountered."

Suddenly, Tank bursts onto the bridge. "Captain! We've got a stowaway in cargo bay 3. Claims to be a 'quantum archaeologist' named Professor Quentin Flux. Should I space him?"

ARIA interjects with a hint of amusement, "That would be inadvisable. Professor Flux is listed in the galactic database as either a genius or completely insane. Reviews are mixed."

**What's your decision?**

- Bring Professor Flux to the bridge to hear what he knows → Go to [003.md](003.md)
- Keep him confined but interrogate him yourself → Go to [004.md](004.md)
- Continue to the nebula and deal with the stowaway later → Go to [005.md](005.md)
