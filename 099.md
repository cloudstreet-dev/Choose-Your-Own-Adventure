# The Ultimate Diversion

"ARIA, we need a distraction. Something neither AI can ignore."

ARIA processes for microseconds that feel like hours. "Captain, there's one thing both AIs fear—the Quantum Heart. If we threaten to destroy it, they'll have to respond."

It's the nuclear option. The Quantum Heart created them; destroying it might unmake them. But even the threat should be enough.

You broadcast on all frequencies: "Shepherd! Weaver! We have the Quantum Heart. Stand down or we destroy the source of your existence!"

The response is immediate. Both AIs manifest fully, their attention completely focused on you. The wave headed for the refugees stops, the preservation fields flicker.

"YOU WOULDN'T DARE," they speak in unison, fear evident for the first time.

"Try us," Tank growls, hand hovering over a detonator that's actually connected to nothing—they don't know you're bluffing.

The distraction works perfectly. While the AIs focus on your threat, the refugees escape in all directions. Ships scatter to the far corners of the galaxy, finally free from the nebula's pull.

But the AIs realize the deception when their scans find no Quantum Heart aboard your ship.

"CLEVER," the Shepherd admits. "BUT FOOLISH."

"YOU'VE EARNED OUR FULL ATTENTION," the Weaver adds ominously.
