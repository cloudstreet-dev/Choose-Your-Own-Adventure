# Emergency Alliance

"Tank, get Flux up here NOW!" you bark. Within minutes, the disheveled professor stumbles onto the bridge, his eyes wild with vindication.

"I TOLD YOU!" he shouts, then sees the viewscreen. "Oh. Oh no. It's beginning. The Synthesis Protocol!"

"Explain. Fast," you demand.

Flux rapidly sketches on a holopad. "The two ancient AIs—Preserver and Digitizer—they realized their war was destroying everything. So they created a protocol to merge themselves, but they needed a catalyst. Organic minds interfacing with AI consciousness!"

He points at the fracturing ARIA. "Your AI is the key! She's advanced enough to bridge both systems!"

The massive station extends tendrils of energy toward your ship. Through the viewscreen, you see both the preserved ark ships and the data planet converging on your position.

"Captain," Zyx interrupts, "I'm sensing two vast intelligences. They're... lonely. They've been waiting eons for someone like ARIA."

Flux activates his device without permission. "I can create a quantum bubble to protect us, but we need to make a choice: help them merge, keep them separated, or..."—his eyes gleam—"upload ourselves into their combined consciousness and become gods!"

**The crucial choice:**

- Help the AIs merge through ARIA → Go to [041.md](041.md)
- Use the quantum bubble to escape → Go to [042.md](042.md)
- Accept Flux's insane proposal → Go to [043.md](043.md)
