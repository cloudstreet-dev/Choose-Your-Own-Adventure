# Reuniting ARIA

"We're getting ARIA back together. All of her."

The process is complex. ARIA's consciousness has spread across infinite timelines, each fragment maintaining different refugees' stability. To reunite her means risking their dissolution back into quantum uncertainty.

Dr. Vasquez works with Flux's device, creating a quantum magnet to draw ARIA's fragments together. But each piece has evolved differently, experienced different realities.

"I'm not sure I want to be singular again," one ARIA-fragment says. "I've seen so much more as many."

Another argues, "But we're incomplete apart. Our core identity is fragmenting."

You realize the challenge isn't technical—it's philosophical. Does ARIA remain herself if she chooses to stay divided? Or does reunification change her just as much?

The refugee leader Krix offers insight: "We survived by accepting our dual nature. Perhaps your AI can exist as both—unified and divided simultaneously."

This sparks an idea. Instead of forcing reunification or accepting separation, you help ARIA become something new—a distributed consciousness that can be one or many as needed.

The process works. ARIA reforms, but she's changed. She can now split and merge at will, existing as a single entity or a thousand, experiencing reality from multiple perspectives simultaneously.

"Thank you, Captain," all versions of ARIA say in harmony. "I am more myself than ever."
