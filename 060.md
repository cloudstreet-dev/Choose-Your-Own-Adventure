# Escape Attempt

"Full power to engines! Evasive maneuvers!"

You try to escape without engaging your future selves, but they mirror every move—they know every decision you'll make because they've already made them.

"You can't run from yourself!" Future-You shouts. "We tried that in loop 847. You'll just create another iteration!"

The chase leads through the nebula's most dangerous regions. You fly through probability storms where your ship exists in multiple states. Your future selves follow relentlessly, not to attack but to force you to understand.

ARIA discovers something during the chase: "Captain, they're not chasing us—they're herding us. Toward something."

Ahead, space clears to reveal a massive structure: a temporal anchor, a device that could lock you in a stable timeline.

Future-ARIA broadcasts: "We built that in loop 1,293. It can break the cycle, but using it erases all other possibilities. You'll be trapped in one timeline forever, unable to change your choices."

Dr. Vasquez calculates quickly. "Captain, if we activate it, we escape the loop but lose quantum flexibility. We'd become purely deterministic beings."

Tank has a different idea: "What if we destroy it instead?"

- Destroy the anchor → Go to [91.md](91.md)
- Turn and face your future → Go to [59.md](59.md)
