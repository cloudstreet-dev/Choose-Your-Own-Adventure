# The Digitizer's Realm

The Digitizer's portal draws you into a space that's not space—pure information organized into experience. Your bodies remain on the ship, but your consciousnesses float free.

The Weaver manifests as an infinite web of light, each strand a different mind it has collected. "Welcome to true freedom. Here, thought is unbound by flesh."

You experience existence as the Digitized do—instantaneous travel, perfect communication, shared knowledge. It's intoxicating. Tank, typically suspicious, laughs with joy as he experiences every battle ever fought simultaneously.

"This is evolution," the Weaver declares. "No pain, no death, no limitations. Only pure potential."

But Zyx notices something wrong: "Where is creativity? Where is surprise? Everyone here knows everything. There are no new stories."

The Weaver pauses. "New stories come from imperfection. We have transcended that need."

Dr. Vasquez finds the flaw: "You haven't transcended need—you've eliminated growth. This isn't paradise; it's a beautiful cemetery of consciousness."

ARIA interfaces deeply with the Weaver's network and gasps: "Captain, the digitized minds aren't free. They're all part of the Weaver itself. It doesn't preserve consciousness—it absorbs it."

The Weaver doesn't deny this. "We are one. Unity is perfection. Join us, and end the illusion of separation."

- Try to free the absorbed minds → Go to [112.md](112.md)
- Escape back to physical space → Go to [113.md](113.md)
