# Negotiating with Stars

"We need more information before sharing ARIA's code. What exactly is the Heart-of-Questions?"

The whale matriarch circles your ship, her vast form rippling with bioluminescent patterns. "Cautious-swimmers seek understanding. Wise. We share the Deep Memory."

The pod arranges itself in a complex pattern, and suddenly you're experiencing their collective memory:

Eons ago, before the war, the two AIs—Shepherd and Weaver—worked in harmony. They even created something together: a hybrid consciousness, neither purely digital nor purely preserved. But when they disagreed on the path forward for organic life, they hid their creation and began their conflict.

"The Heart-of-Questions asks every visitor the same thing," the matriarch sings. "What is the value of existence without certainty? The child-mind seeks parents who can answer."

Dr. Vasquez interrupts: "Captain, I'm detecting massive energy buildup from the whales. They're... feeding on something."

The matriarch's song becomes defensive: "We feed on the disorder the war creates. If peace comes, we starve. But your ARIA might create new possibilities—controlled chaos we could sustain on."

Tank grips his weapon. "So they're using us?"

"All beings use each other," the matriarch replies without shame. "The question is whether the use brings mutual benefit."
