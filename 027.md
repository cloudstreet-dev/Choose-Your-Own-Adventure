# The Observer's Path

You decide to maintain distance and document everything. Sometimes, the greatest discovery is knowing when not to interfere.

Dr. Vasquez sets up deep scans while ARIA records everything. What you discover changes everything you thought you knew about the universe.

The ark isn't just preserving species—it's preserving entire timelines. Each stasis pod contains not just a being, but every possible version of their life.

"Captain," Vasquez whispers in awe, "this is a quantum archive of evolution itself. Every path life could have taken is stored here."

Flux, still in the brig, somehow hacks into the comm system: "You fools! Observing it changes it! The Uncertainty Principle applies to entire civilizations here!"

He's right. Your scans have disturbed the quantum preservation. Some pods begin cycling through possibilities—species evolving and devolving in seconds, civilizations rising and falling in heartbeats.

The ark's intelligence finally notices you. "Observers. You see but do not choose. This is wise... or cowardly. I offer you a gift: the complete history of a thousand dead civilizations. But knowledge has a price—you must carry their memories forever."

- Decline and continue exploring → Go to [081.md](081.md)
- Offer to help stabilize the disturbed pods → Go to [082.md](082.md)
