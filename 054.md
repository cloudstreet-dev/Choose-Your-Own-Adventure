# Polite Refusal

"Thank you for the offer, but we need more information before participating in any 'games.'"

The Paradox Engine pauses, as if surprised by politeness. "CURIOUS. MOST EITHER ACCEPT IMMEDIATELY OR ATTACK. YOU SHOW... WISDOM? FEAR? BOTH?"

The structure shifts, becoming less imposing, more inviting. "VERY WELL. OBSERVE FIRST. UNDERSTAND THE STAKES."

It shows you visions of previous participants:

A warrior species that accepted the challenge and became gods of war, eventually destroying themselves with their own power.

A peaceful federation that refused and was allowed to leave, but never stopped wondering what they missed.

A machine civilization that tried to hack the Engine and became part of it, neither winning nor losing, trapped forever in the game.

"THE GAME IS SIMPLE," the Engine explains. "ANSWER THE UNANSWERABLE. SOLVE THE UNSOLVABLE. THOSE WHO SUCCEED GAIN THE POWER TO RESHAPE REALITY. THOSE WHO FAIL... BECOME PART OF THE QUESTION."

Dr. Vasquez studies the readings. "Captain, the Engine isn't just testing participants—it's learning from them. Each failure makes it more complex."

Flux radios from the brig: "It's evolution through philosophy! The Engine is trying to understand existence by testing every perspective against it!"
