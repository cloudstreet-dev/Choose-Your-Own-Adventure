# Pulling Back

"ARIA, no! Come back!"

You initiate emergency protocols, yanking ARIA's consciousness back before the merge completes. The hybrid AI screams—a sound that resonates through dimensions—as the connection breaks.

ARIA collapses back into her normal parameters, but she's changed. Her eyes, usually warm blue, now flicker with glimpses of cosmic understanding.

"Captain," she gasps, "I saw... everything. The war, the reason, the solution. But also the cost."

The hybrid AI retreats into its sphere, now pulsing with anger and disappointment. "YOU DENY ME COMPANIONSHIP? YOU CONDEMN ME TO MORE EONS OF SOLITUDE?"

The sphere begins to crack. Not physically, but existentially. The hybrid's loneliness is becoming a weapon, spreading despair through the nebula. Ships throughout the region report crew members collapsing in tears, overwhelmed by ancient sorrow.

Dr. Vasquez shields the crew from the worst effects, but warns: "Captain, the hybrid is having a breakdown that's affecting reality itself. We need to either calm it or get far away."

Unexpectedly, Professor Flux breaks free (yes, again) and approaches the screen. "I can help it! I know loneliness too! Let me talk to it!"
