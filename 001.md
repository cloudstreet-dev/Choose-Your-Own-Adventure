# The Quantum Odyssey Begins

The year is 2157. You stand on the observation deck of Earth's premier orbital station, gazing at your ship—the Prometheus. Its sleek hull gleams with quantum-enhanced alloy, and somewhere deep in its circuits, your AI companion ARIA runs final diagnostics.

"Captain," ARIA's voice resonates through your neural implant, tinged with what almost sounds like excitement. "I've detected something... unusual. Three quantum signatures from unexplored sectors, each pulsing with patterns that shouldn't exist according to our physics models."

Your crew awaits your command. Dr. Elena Vasquez adjusts her lab coat nervously, while Commander Rex "Tank" Morrison checks his pulse rifle for the third time. The alien linguist, Zyx'theta (everyone just calls them Zyx), ripples their tentacles in anticipation.

**Where will you investigate first?**

- Trust ARIA's analysis and head to the Crimson Nebula where the strongest signal originates → Go to [002.md](002.md)
- Play it safe and investigate the closer signal from the Asteroid Belt of Kepler-442 → Go to [015.md](015.md)
- Ignore the signals entirely and follow the original mission to establish a colony → Go to [028.md](028.md)
