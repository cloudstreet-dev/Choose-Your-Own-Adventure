# Escape from the Nebula

With refugees aboard, you flee the nebula entirely. The journey out is treacherous—the refugees' presence creates unexpected resonances with the quantum storms.

Many refugees panic as you leave, feeling the data planet's pull weaken. For some, resisting had become their entire identity. Without the constant struggle, they don't know who they are.

Dr. Vasquez runs support groups in the cargo bay. Beings share their stories of resistance, the loved ones they lost to digitization, the strength they found in staying physical.

As you near the nebula's edge, both ancient AIs manifest. "You cannot leave with our subjects," they speak in unison. "The preserved and the resistant belong to the great experiment."

Krix stands defiant: "We belong to no one! We chose neither preservation nor digitization. We choose freedom!"

The AIs consider this. The concept of truly free choice, without influence from either philosophy, seems to puzzle them.

ARIA makes an observation: "Captain, the refugees have become something neither AI expected—beings who've experienced both temptations and rejected them. They're living proof that the choice doesn't have to be binary."

The path out clears, surprisingly. The AIs are letting you leave, but why?
