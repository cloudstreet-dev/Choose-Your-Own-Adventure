# Quantum Evacuation

"Everyone off that ship! Now!"

You begin evacuating the superpositioned crew, but each person you bring aboard collapses the quantum state further. Reality strains and buckles around you.

Commander Chen grabs your arm. "Captain, you don't understand! We found it—the source of everything! The Quantum Heart is what created the AIs! It's a piece of the universe from before the Big Bang!"

As more crew materialize, their stories overlap:
"We found paradise—"
"We found hell—"
"We found the answer—"
"We found only questions—"

All simultaneously true.

The duplicate Prometheus ships outside begin merging and splitting repeatedly. ARIA warns, "Captain, we're creating a paradox cascade! Reality is breaking down!"

Dr. Vasquez realizes the problem: "Each crew member exists in multiple states. By choosing which version to save, we're splitting the timeline!"

Through the chaos, you see it—the Quantum Heart, floating in the derelict's core. It's beautiful and terrible, a sphere of pure possibility that hurts to perceive directly.

Tank, ever practical, suggests: "What if we just blow it up?"

Chen screams, "No! It's the seed of a new universe! Destroying it would—"

She doesn't finish. Reality fractures.
