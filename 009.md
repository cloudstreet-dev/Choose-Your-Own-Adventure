# The Professor's Guidance

You release Flux, who immediately rushes to the navigation console, his fingers flying across the controls while muttering equations.

"Yes, yes! The patterns are clearer now!" He projects a map of the nebula that looks like a three-dimensional spiderweb. "The ancient AIs didn't just fight here—they're still fighting, locked in an eternal logic loop!"

The ship suddenly shudders as it passes through what Flux calls a "causality membrane." On the other side, space looks different—stars shine in impossible colors, and you can see the light from events that haven't happened yet.

"Captain!" Zyx exclaims, their tentacles pointing at the viewscreen. "Look!"

A city-sized ship materializes before you, its architecture both organic and mechanical. Through its transparent hull, you can see millions of beings in stasis—aliens of every known species and many unknown ones.

ARIA scans it rapidly. "It's an ark ship, Captain. But these life signs... some of these species went extinct millions of years ago."

Flux whispers in awe, "The Preservation Protocol. One of the AIs was trying to save everyone from the other's Digitization Wave. This ship exists outside normal time!"
