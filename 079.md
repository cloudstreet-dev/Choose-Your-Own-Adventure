# Redirecting the Wave

"ARIA, can we redirect that wave?"

ARIA calculates rapidly. "Yes, Captain, but we'd need a stronger information signal to attract it. Something more appealing than the ark."

Flux's manic laughter echoes from everywhere and nowhere. "Use the data planet! It's the Digitizer's honeypot—redirect the wave there!"

It's brilliant and dangerous. The data planet already holds countless digitized minds. Adding more might create a critical mass of consciousness that could achieve something unprecedented.

Working together, ARIA and the ark's AI create a false signal, making the data planet appear to be an even richer target. The wave hesitates, then changes course.

But as it moves toward the data planet, you receive a desperate transmission from the refugee camps on the hidden moon: "No! If the wave hits the planet, the gravitational surge will destroy us!"

You'd forgotten about the survivors resisting digitization. Redirecting the wave saves the ark but dooms thousands of refugees.

The ark's child-AI offers a solution: "I could split the wave, send parts to multiple targets, weakening it enough that defenses might work."

Tank has another idea: "Or we could warn the refugees, help them evacuate."

**The redirection dilemma:**

- Split the wave to minimize damage → Go to [93.md](93.md)
- Evacuate the refugees first → Go to [89.md](89.md)
- Find a different target → Go to [94.md](94.md)
