# Battle Stations

"All hands, battle stations! Tank, what do we have?"

Tank grins—finally, something he understands. "Pulse cannons, quantum torpedoes, and one experimental singularity bomb I definitely didn't steal from Earth's weapons lab."

The alien ships approach in perfect formation. They're beautiful and terrible—crafted from materials that shift between states of matter, weapons that fire beams of pure entropy.

The derelict captain provides tactical data: "They're the Harvesters! They feed on consciousness itself! They were drawn by our time-loop—twisted space-time is like candy to them!"

The battle is unlike anything in your training. The Harvesters don't just attack your ship—they attack your timeline. One beam ages your hull by centuries. Another reverses your ammunition, sending torpedoes backward through time.

ARIA adapts quickly, predicting their temporal attacks. "Captain, I can match their temporal weapons, but I'll need to merge with the ship's systems completely."

Flux shouts from the brig: "Use my device! You can probability-shift their attacks into missing!"

Dr. Vasquez has another idea: "The twisted derelict—we could use it as a temporal bomb!"

**Battle tactics:**

- Let ARIA merge with the ship → Go to [119.md](119.md) [ENDING 9: The Living Ship]
- Use Flux's probability device → Go to [120.md](120.md)
- Turn the derelict into a weapon → Go to [121.md](121.md)
