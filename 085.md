# Understanding the Loop

"Explain how this happened. We need to understand before deciding."

The colony's temporal scientists, your descendants who inherited your curiosity, bring you to their research center. The walls are covered with equations that hurt to look at—mathematics that won't be invented for centuries.

"It began with the quantum signals," they explain. "When the first Prometheus—your ship—investigated them, it created a causal loop. The signals exist because you investigate them, and you investigate them because they exist."

Dr. Vasquez studies their data. "But that's impossible. Something had to start the loop."

"That's the beauty," they reply. "The loop has no beginning. It's a closed timelike curve. It simply IS."

They show you the colony's history—or future, depending on perspective. Every generation knows their fate, sees their descendants and ancestors simultaneously. Children are born knowing when they'll die, lovers meet knowing how it ends.

"It's not sad," a young girl who is also an old woman explains. "We experience our entire lives at once. Every moment is always happening."

Zyx's descendant, evolved into something barely recognizable, adds: "We've become fourth-dimensional beings, experiencing time as you experience space."

ARIA discovers something crucial: "Captain, the loop isn't just protecting the colony. It's protecting the entire galaxy. If we break it, the AI war spreads to Earth in exactly 47.3 years."

- Accept the loop to protect Earth → Go to [83.md](83.md)
- Break it and try to prevent the war → Go to [87.md](87.md)
- Look for a way to expand the loop's protection → Go to [88.md](88.md)
