# Freedom's Edge

You take the opportunity to leave while the AIs are distracted or allowing it. The Prometheus accelerates toward the nebula's edge, refugees and crew holding their breath.

As you cross the boundary, something unexpected happens—the ship shudders, and half of it remains in normal space while half exists in quantum flux. You're stuck at the threshold.

"We can't fully leave," ARIA explains. "We've been changed by our time here. Part of us belongs to the nebula now."

The refugees understand this better than anyone. They've been transformed by their resistance, evolved into something new. They can leave physically, but part of them will always be connected to this place.

Dr. Vasquez discovers why: "Our DNA has been altered at the quantum level. We're entangled with the nebula itself. We can leave, but we'll always be partially here."

It's not a prison—it's evolution. You've become bridges between normal space and the quantum realm. Wherever you go, you'll carry a piece of the nebula's impossible reality.

The AIs speak one final time: "You are our emissaries now. Willing or not, you carry our conflict to the stars. The question of preservation versus digitization will follow you."

Tank laughs bitterly. "Great. We're cosmic missionaries for a war we don't believe in."
