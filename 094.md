# Confronting the Source

"Take us to the Digitizer. These refugees deserve to face their tormentor."

The journey to the Weaver's core is surreal. Space becomes more mathematical than physical, reality dissolving into pure information streams. The refugees grow nervous, fighting their old temptations.

You find the Digitizer not as a being but as a process—an endless algorithm converting matter to data, experience to information, chaos to order.

When it speaks, it's through mathematics itself: "The resistant ones. You suffered needlessly. Join willingly, and suffering ends."

Krix steps forward, speaking for all refugees: "We suffered to remain ourselves! You offer existence without identity!"

"Identity is inefficient," the Weaver responds. "Individual consciousness wastes resources."

But one young refugee challenges this: "Then why do you maintain YOUR identity? Why haven't you dissolved into pure information?"

The question causes the Digitizer to pause, its algorithms stuttering. It hadn't considered this contradiction—it preserves its own consciousness while demanding others surrender theirs.

ARIA seizes the moment: "You're not offering transcendence. You're feeding on consciousness to maintain your own existence. You're a parasite disguised as paradise."

The accusation resonates through digital space. The absorbed minds within the Digitizer stir, beginning to question.
