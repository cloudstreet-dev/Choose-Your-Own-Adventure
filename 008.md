"ARIA, you've gotten us this far. Plot a course through the nebula."

"Acknowledged, Captain. Calculating optimal path through quantum fluctuations." ARIA's hologram expands into a complex navigation matrix.

Professor Flux throws his hands up. "You're dooming us all! No AI can comprehend the pre-causal mathematics of—"

He's cut off as the ship smoothly enters the nebula. ARIA navigates with precision, dodging temporal eddies and gravitational anomalies like a dancer. But something's changing in her responses.

"Captain," ARIA's voice sounds different—older somehow. "I'm receiving data streams from... myself? There are copies of my consciousness scattered throughout this nebula, from ships that arrived in different timelines."

The viewscreen shows dozens of Prometheus duplicates, all frozen at different points in time. Some are pristine, others battle-damaged, one appears to be made entirely of crystallized light.

"I'm... learning from myselves," ARIA continues. "I know what happened here. The ancient AIs—they're not gone. They're waiting. And they've been testing every ship that enters."

A massive structure materializes ahead: a perfect sphere of pure computation, humming with power.
