# Helping the Transcended

"We'll help you return to physical form."

The Transcended respond with a mixture of hope and fear. "We have calculated every possibility, but we cannot calculate the feeling of wind, the taste of food, the comfort of uncertainty."

Dr. Vasquez works with ARIA to devise a solution. "We can create hybrid bodies—partially organic, partially digital. You won't be fully human, but you'll be physical enough to experience sensation again."

The process begins with volunteers from the Transcended. As the first digital consciousness downloads into a hybrid body, their reaction is profound. They laugh, then cry, then laugh again.

"I had forgotten," they whisper, touching their own face in wonder. "I had forgotten what it felt like to feel."

But not all Transcended want to return. A faction emerges, calling themselves the Purists, who see physical form as regression.

"You offer us devolution!" their leader declares. "We have surpassed the need for flesh!"

The two factions begin to conflict, their battle fought in nanoseconds across digital space but affecting physical reality. Your ship shakes as their war spills into real space.

Tank prepares weapons. "Great, we started a civil war among gods."
