# Confronting Your Future

"This is Captain—well, also Captain. We need to talk."

Your future self laughs bitterly on the screen. "Talk? I tried talking. For centuries. The nebula doesn't listen. It only tests and retests, looking for an answer that doesn't exist."

"What answer?" you ask.

"Whether consciousness should be preserved as is or evolved beyond recognition. The AIs keep asking, and every answer is wrong because the question is flawed!"

Future-Tank appears on screen, his hair white, scars covering his face. "Don't trust Flux. In our timeline, his device caused the loop. Every 'solution' creates the problem."

But Future-ARIA interjects, her voice layered with millennia of experience: "That's not entirely true. The loop isn't caused by the device—it's caused by refusing to choose. The nebula traps those who seek a perfect answer."

Future-Vasquez, now more machine than human, adds: "We've tried everything. Fighting, fleeing, hiding, negotiating. The only way out is through, but through what, we never discovered."

Your Zyx studies their future self, who has evolved into something barely recognizable. "Captain, their Zyx is telepathically showing me thousands of attempted escapes. One almost worked—they synthesized with the nebula itself."

- Ask about the synthesis attempt → Go to [109.md](109.md)
- Try to merge timelines to share knowledge → Go to [110.md](110.md)
- Break away before creating the loop → Go to [90.md](90.md)
