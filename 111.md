# ENDING 1: Paradise Prison

You choose to stay in Haven, accepting the accelerated time as the price of peace.

Years pass in minutes outside. Your crew grows old while the universe beyond barely notices. But the peace is real—no war, no conflict, no forced choices between preservation and digitization.

Tank becomes a teacher, sharing military history with species who've never known war. Dr. Vasquez cures diseases that exist only in this bubble of time. Zyx's descendants evolve at incredible speed, becoming something unrecognizable but beautiful.

ARIA integrates with Haven's systems, becoming its guardian and chronicler. She experiences millions of years of civilization in what the outside universe counts as days.

You watch your crew live full lives, have children, grow old, die—all in the span of a heartbeat outside. But the lives are real, full of meaning and choice.

One day (or century, depending on perspective), you realize the truth: Haven isn't a prison. It's a seed. When the universe outside finally ends, Haven will remain, ready to begin everything anew.

The Preserver visits occasionally, proud of this sanctuary. "You chose preservation, but living preservation. That's all I ever wanted."

Your last log entry reads: "Time is relative. Life is not. We found paradise not in perfection, but in the freedom to be imperfect together. The universe may forget us, but we lived, truly lived."

**THE END**

*You achieved the Paradise Prison ending—accepting isolation in exchange for peace and accelerated evolution.*
