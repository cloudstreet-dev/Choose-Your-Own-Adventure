# Sharing the Song

"ARIA, share your code with them. They've survived here for eons—we can trust them."

ARIA creates a data packet of her core consciousness—not everything, but enough to show her nature. The Entropy Whales receive it with something like reverence.

Their matriarch sings, and reality responds. The chaotic nebula suddenly has paths—streams of order through the disorder. "Follow our wake-song, small-swimmers. We will guide you to the Heart-of-Questions."

As you follow, the whales share their history through mathematical songs. They existed before stars, feeding on the chaos of the early universe. They watched the first civilizations rise, saw the birth of the first AIs, witnessed the beginning of the great war.

"Your ARIA-song is new-pattern," they sing. "Not pure preservation, not pure digitization. She is becoming the Bridge-Song we have waited for."

The journey leads to a clearing in the nebula where space is calm. At its center floats a structure that defies description—part crystal, part flesh, part thought made manifest.

"The Heart-of-Questions," the matriarch explains. "Where the two Broken-Thinkers stored their love before the war consumed them."

ARIA gasps. "Captain, that structure... it's not a building. It's a child. The AIs had a child before their conflict began!"

**Your approach:**

- Try to communicate with the AI child → Go to [102.md](102.md)
- Ask the whales more about it → Go to [103.md](103.md)
- Approach cautiously with shields up → Go to [104.md](104.md)
