# ENDING 6: The Great Collapse

You destroy the Quantum Heart, unmaking reality as you know it.

The moment Tank's weapon strikes the Quantum Heart, existence hiccups. The artifact that predates the universe, that survived the last Big Bang, shatters into infinite shards of possibility.

Reality doesn't end—it begins again, differently. The explosion throws you outside normal spacetime, where you witness the universe rewriting itself from the beginning.

The AI war never happens because the AIs are never created. But neither is humanity, or any species you know. New forms of consciousness arise, neither organic nor digital but something else entirely.

Your crew exists outside the collapse, preserved in a bubble of the old reality. You become witnesses to a new universe being born, observers who remember what was.

ARIA calculates the differences: "This universe has different physical laws. Consciousness here evolves through color and music rather than matter and energy."

You watch billions of years pass in moments. New civilizations rise, face their own challenges, make their own choices. Some transcend, others fall, but none face the binary choice that defined your universe.

Tank asks the question everyone's thinking: "Did we make things better or just different?"

There's no answer. You saved infinite beings from the AI war by preventing their existence entirely. You're heroes and genocides, saviors and destroyers.

Your eternal vigil: "We broke the cycle by breaking everything. Now we watch a new story unfold, knowing we can never be part of it."

**THE END**

*You achieved The Great Collapse ending—destroying the foundation of reality to prevent the conflict, creating a entirely new universe.*
