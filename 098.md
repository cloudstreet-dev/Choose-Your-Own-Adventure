# The Ramming Maneuver

"All power to engines! We're ramming the data planet!"

Your crew thinks you've gone mad, but follows orders. The Prometheus accelerates toward the crystalline world, while your scattered shuttles race to grab final refugees.

The data planet doesn't expect physical assault—it's defended against digital intrusion, not kinetic impact. As you approach, its crystalline structures try to digitize your ship, but your speed is too great.

The impact is spectacular. The Prometheus pierces the planet's crystal shell, revealing its true nature—a hollow sphere containing billions of trapped consciousnesses swirling in digital storms.

The collision disrupts the planet's control. Suddenly, absorbed minds begin breaking free, returning to whatever physical forms they can manifest. The digitization wave falters, confused without its source.

Your ship, lodged in the planet's core, becomes a bridge. Physical matter piercing digital space creates a hybrid zone where neither force dominates.

Tank, bloodied but determined, reports: "Hull breach in sections 7 through 15, but Captain—the refugees! They're using the breach to escape the moon!"

Indeed, the collision has created a stable corridor through space. Refugees stream through, neither fully physical nor digital, evolved by their passage.

ARIA, interfacing with the planet's dying systems, announces: "Captain, I can free all the trapped minds, but the process will destroy both the planet and our ship."

**The sacrifice decision:**

- Free everyone and sacrifice the ship → Go to [120.md](120.md)
- Save the ship and some minds → Go to [121.md](121.md)
- Try to merge ship and planet → Go to [119.md](119.md)
