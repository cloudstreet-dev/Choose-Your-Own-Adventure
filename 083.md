# Closing the Loop

"We stay. We complete the time loop."

Your decision ripples through spacetime. The colony that shouldn't exist solidifies, becoming real because you chose to make it real. The paradox resolves by embracing itself.

Tank's grandmother/descendant smiles. "You've chosen wisdom. Now we can tell you the truth—the loop isn't a prison, it's protection."

She leads you to the colony's center, where a massive temporal shield generator hums. "The quantum signals weren't to lure you—they were warnings to keep others away. This pocket of spacetime is the only place safe from the AI war's eventual spread."

Your crew settles into the colony, but with the strange knowledge that your descendants have already lived here for centuries. Children you haven't had yet greet you by name. Buildings you'll design in the future already stand.

Dr. Vasquez studies the temporal mechanics: "We age normally, but the colony exists in all times simultaneously. We're living our entire timeline at once."

ARIA integrates with the colony's systems and gasps: "Captain, from here I can see the entire war's timeline. It ends in 2,847 years when the last star burns out. Unless..."

Your descendant/ancestors reveal the colony's purpose: "We're the seed. When the universe ends, we begin it again. The Big Bang isn't the beginning—it's our reset."
